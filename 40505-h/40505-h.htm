In this HTML version, page numbers are listed in the right margin,
hyperlinks are indicated by a dotted underline, and transcriber comments
are marked by a red dashed underline; scrolling the mouse over such
words will reveal the original text. Footnote markers in the text are
hyperlinked to the footnotes located at the end of the book.<br />

<br />
The book contains numerous spelling inconsistencies. No change has been
made to those representing archaic spellings (e.g. <i>somethimes</i>, <i>urin</i>,
<i>feavers</i>, <i>joynts</i>) and those occurring in quotations. Spelling
variants occurring with similar frequency have been left in their
original form (e.g. Röntgen/Roentgen, rachitic/rhachitic,
albumen/albumin &ndash; the correct spellings is used for egg albumen
but both are used randomly for serum/urine albumin). Most other spelling
inconsistencies have been changed to the more-frequent or more-accurate
form (e.g. twofold&#8594;two-fold, guinea pig&#8594;guinea-pig,
oedema&#8594;edema, neuroedema&#8594;neuredema, gm.&#8594;g.,
Luborsch&#8594;Lubarsch, Bauman&#8594;Baumann,
McCluggage&#8594;McClugage, Eijkmann&#8594;Eijkman). Although the
spelling of 'fæces' and its adjective 'fecal' is not consistent, the two
spellings are used consistently throughout the book and therefore have
not been altered. Similarly 'hemorrhage' and 'hemoglobin' are
consistently spelt thus, while other words pertaining to blood
consistently use the æ ligature, e.g. 'hæmatemesis', 'hæmatoma',
'hæmaturia', 'leukæmia', 'hyperæmia'.<br />
<br />
Wrong or missing French accents and typos have been corrected where
necessary. German expressions in the bibliography contain various
apparent inconsistencies that have not been changed because of my
unfamiliarity with the language and what was perhaps legitimate at the
time of writing (e.g. Moeller-Barlow'sche Krankheit,
Moeller-Barlow'scher Krankheit, Moeller-Barlowscher Krankheit and
Barlow'schen Krankheit; Muench. med. Woch., Muenchn. med. Woch. and
Muenschner med. Woch.; Beiträge z., Beitraege zur, Beitrag zur). The
term <i>Gernest-mark</i> on p. 108 should probably be <i>geruestmark</i> (or
perhaps gerüstmark) as used elsewhere in the book (pp. 96, 107, 108 and
128).<br />
<br />
The book also contains numerous hyphenation inconsistencies. Some of
these have been altered to conform with the most common usage in the
text, but most have not been changed because hyphenation is notoriously
variable and subject to fashion.<br />
<br />
Subheading use is somewhat inconsistent; for example, under the
subheading <i>Alimentary Tract</i> in chapter IV, there appear various
non-alimentary items, and in the same chapter <i>Microscopic Pathology</i>
appears as a stand-alone subheading whilst its equivalent <i>Gross
Pathology</i> is relegated to an in-line paragraph introduction.<br />
<br />
The bibliography contains two very similar references attributed to Gee.
The second appears to be a duplicate of the first, but it is probable
that the title is incorrect because the publication details (1889, XXV,
85) relate to a different paper by Gee entitled &lsquo;Bloody Urine the
Only Sign of Infantile Scurvy&rsquo;, and although there are several
comments in the book about scurvy and haematuria (blood in the urine),
e.g. p. 204, none cite Gee's paper.<br />
<br />
The second entry for Morse, J. L. in the bibliography should be numbered
as (2) and the source should be Boston Med. and Surg. Journal, 1914,
CLXX, 504. (not Jour. Am. Med. Assn.)<br />
<br />
Inconsistent punctuation in the bibliography list has been corrected
(e.g. semicolon&#8594;colon).<br />

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Interest in scurvy has been stimulated in the last
few years as the result of a new and broader conception
of nutrition. It has come to be realized that in addition
to the substances heretofore recognized as of essential
importance in the dietary&mdash;the proteins, fats, carbohydrates
and the salts&mdash;there is still another group, termed
&ldquo;vitamines,&rdquo; &ldquo;accessory food factors&rdquo; or &ldquo;food hormones,&rdquo;
which must be included in order to render the
diet complete and adequate. It has become increasingly
evident that the attention of physiologists and of clinicians
has been focussed too sharply and too narrowly on the
caloric value of foodstuffs. At the same time we have
begun to appreciate the existence of a group of nutritional
disorders which depend largely on a deficiency of these
illusive vitamines or food factors, and which evidently
are of vital importance to the welfare of the individual
and of mankind. Scurvy is one of this newly-constituted
group, and due to this association has acquired a fresh
and broader significance. It is in this light that the intensive
research work must be interpreted, which has been
applied within the past few years, both in this country
and abroad, to problems relating to this disorder. It is
clear that the subject is in its infancy, and is destined to
participate in a consideration of many of the nutritional
and infectious diseases of the adult and the child.</p>

<p>The World War has tended also to demand a renewed
consideration of scurvy. This disorder has played a rôle
in all wars&mdash;in the campaigns of the Cæsars, the pilgrim
ages of the Crusaders, and the numerous wars of the last
century. In the recent war it existed among the various<span class="pagenum" title="iv"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a></span>
armies, particularly those in the East, to an extent greater
than at first was realized. In Mesopotamia it is stated to
have been one of the decisive factors in forcing the surrender
of the British at Kut. Its incidence, however, was
not limited to the military forces. Reports from England
and the continental countries clearly indicate that scurvy
prevailed among the civilian population during the past
few years to a degree unknown in peace times. This was
especially true of infants and children.</p>

<p>For the past seven years I have been engaged in an
investigation of scurvy both in the laboratory and in
the clinic, and have treated various aspects of the subject
in a large number of articles published in various medical
journals. In the course of these studies there has been
ample opportunity for a comprehensive review of the
widely-scattered literature. No treatise on scurvy has
been published in English since the classical work of
Lind in 1772. The time, therefore, seemed opportune to
gather into one volume the recent advances in this field
and to offer to the clinician, to the hygienist, and to the
biological chemist a presentation of the existing status
of this important nutritional disease.</p>

<p>It is with pleasure that I acknowledge my obligation
to Dr. Lester J. Unger, who has assisted in carrying out
much of the work described in this volume. Thanks are
due also to Dr. Charles Gottlieb for the radiographs which
are here reproduced, and to Dr. Gertrude McCann for
seeing the work through the press. To my associates in
the clinic who shared in the observations, and to friends
who read various chapters in the course of their preparation,
I wish to express my appreciation.</p>

HISTORY OF SCURVY<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></h2>


<p><b>Outbreaks on Land.</b>&mdash;Like many other diseases, the life history of
scurvy shows several distinct phases. We hear of it first as a plague,
infesting armies and besieged towns; then as a dread disease, decimating
the sailors of the navy and of the mercantile marine, and, since the end
of the last century, more often as a nutritional disturbance,
endangering the health of infants. Very recently it has acquired an
entirely new interest, as the representative of a class of disorders
which has revealed the essential importance to man of unknown dietary
factors.</p>

<p>It is difficult, as may be imagined, to define with precision the
earliest description of scurvy, as the older references are so vague as
to be open to individual interpretation. The reference of Hippocrates to
a large number of men in the army who suffered from pains in the legs
and gangrene of the gums, which was accompanied by loss of teeth, seems
sufficiently definite to be identified as this disease. The Greek, Roman
and Arabian writers do not seem to have been acquainted with<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
scurvy. This is as we should expect, for fruits and vegetables grew in
such plenty in these southern countries that scurvy must have been a
disorder of rare occurrence.</p>

<p>An interesting early description of scurvy, and one
which is quite convincing, is that of de Joinville, who
accompanied the Crusaders in their invasion of Egypt
under St. Lewis, about the middle of the thirteenth century.
He refers to the lividity and spongy condition of
the gums, and describes how &ldquo;the barber surgeons were
forced to cut away the dead flesh from the gums to enable
the people to masticate their food&rdquo; he describes their
debility, their tendency to faint, and the black spots on
their legs. The disease broke out in Lent, during which
time the soldiers partook of no meat, but consumed a
species of eel which they believed &ldquo;ate the dead people&rdquo;
and therefore led to this loathsome disease.</p>

<p>It is probable that scurvy existed in the northern parts
of Europe and Asia ever since they were settled by man.
We should hardly expect to have records of this condition,
in view of the low educational status of the people, their
greatly restricted literature, and their lack of intercourse
with the people in the southern countries. In the sixteenth
century, with the development and spread of education,
we begin to hear of scurvy from various sources. Claus
Magnus, in his &ldquo;History of the Northern Nations,&rdquo; published
in 1555, described the disease which he tells us
flourished among the soldiers in the camps and in the
prisons. About this time Ronsseus, Echtius and Wierus
wrote special treatises on this disease, and recommended
many dietary measures which we recognize to-day as most
efficacious. The number of monographs on this subject
multiplied with great rapidity in the course of the next
twenty-five or fifty years; none of them, however, added
anything essential to our knowledge. In 1645 the Faculty<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
of Medicine at Copenhagen published a &ldquo;consilium&rdquo; for
the benefit of the poor, treating of the causes, prevention
and cure of this disease, which was prevalent among the
Danes and other northern nations.</p>

<p>The colonists of the northern part of America were
sorely afflicted with scurvy. It is said that the French
met with such high mortality during the severe winters
in Canada, that they frequently debated the wisdom of
abandoning this settlement. This was true also in regard
to the English and their settlement in Newfoundland.
Indeed, it was scurvy which forced the early settlers in
Hudson Bay to discontinue their intentions of colonizing
that region.</p>

<p>In an essay published in the eighteenth century (1734),
Bachstrom described an epidemic of scurvy which
occurred in 1703 during the siege of Thorn, in Prussia,
by the Swedes, which caused the death of 5000 of the garrison,
in addition to a large number of the inhabitants.
It is interesting to note that this epidemic took place in
the middle of the summer, and not in the cold season.
From this time on we meet with many descriptions of
scurvy in connection with the wars at various periods.
For instance, in the Russian armies, in the war between
the Austrians and the Turks in 1720; in the English
troops who had taken Quebec from the French in 1759;
among the French soldiers in the army of the Alps in the
spring of 1795. It is unnecessary to review these accounts
in detail. This period is distinguished rather by the
appearance of a great classic on Scurvy, the work of the
English naval hygienist, Lind (1752). This book has
intrinsic value to-day, and, at the time it appeared, served
to crystallize the conception of scurvy, which had been
stretched out of all proportions to include an ever-increasing<span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>
conglomeration of clinical conditions. Scurvy had
become the Alpha and Omega of professional routine,
the catchword of the day, the asylum ignorantiæ of the
practical man. Into this chaos, as Hirsch expresses it,
&ldquo;the first beams of light fell when Lind&rsquo;s classical
work appeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It will be of little value to consider the great number
of epidemics of scurvy which occurred from this time to
the present day. They may be found in tabular form in
the excellent survey of scurvy by Hirsch. The literature
of this long period may likewise be found in a work of
encyclopædic character, that of Krebel, which gives the
titles, with a summary of the various articles on this subject,
appearing to the year 1859. If we look over the
chronological table compiled by Hirsch, we note a remarkable
similarity regarding the incidence of the recurring
epidemics. In almost all cases they broke out among
troops, whether in Russia, in India, in Africa, or in our
United States. The epidemics which are not attributable
to military life or campaigns are found to have taken
place generally in prisons, insane asylums, poorhouses or
houses of refuge and correction. It would seem that no
war is omitted from this list of sickness and death. There
are in all 143 land epidemics between 1556 and 1877, two
occurring in the sixteenth century, four in the seventeenth,
33 in the eighteenth, and 104 in the nineteenth century.
The marked increase in the nineteenth century occurred
in institutions, in asylums and prisons, rather than in the
armies. This fact may be ascribed to altered social conditions
which led to a great multiplication of eleemosynary
institutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span></p>

<p>Coming down to more recent times, we learn that
scurvy occurred extensively during the Crimean War, and
that it was prevalent also among the troops in our own
Civil War. In the &ldquo;Medical and Surgical History of the
War of the Rebellion,&rdquo; we find the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A scorbutic tendency was developed at most of our
military posts during the winter season, after the troops
had been confined to the use of the ordinary ration with
the desiccated vegetables. The latter in the quantities
failed to repress the disease. At posts which could be
readily supplied with potatoes only the taint was manifested,
on account of a want of liberality in the issues.&rdquo;
And again: &ldquo;Among the white troops during the five and
one-sixth years covered by the statistics, 30,714 cases of
scurvy were reported; and 383 deaths were attributed
directly to that disease.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Munson writes: &ldquo;It (scurvy) prevailed among our
troops during the Civil War and its recognition was a
surprise and shock to professional ideas preconceived
from practice in civil life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As is well known, the besieged in Paris during the
Franco-Prussian War in the winter of 1870&ndash;71 suffered
severely from scurvy. The accounts of their pitiable condition
have been portrayed for us by numerous French
writers (Delpech, Hayem, Lasèque and Legroux). The
people lived mainly on rice and bread, with an occasional
addition of potatoes or horse meat. The winter was exceptionally
severe, which was supposed to have intensified
the scorbutic condition. Not only were the inmates of the
prisons on the Seine attacked, numbering about one thousand,
but even the patients in the military hospitals developed
the disease. It is of interest to remember that the
siege lasted but little over four months, from September
17th to January 27th, the date of the armistice.<span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span></p>

<p>In the Russo-Japanese War, after the siege of Port
Arthur, it was found that one-half of the garrison of
17,000 men had scurvy.</p>

<p>Although there are certain parts of the world where
scurvy is of frequent occurrence, no country has been
entirely free from it. As might be expected, it has been
particularly prevalent in the North, where vegetation
is scanty&mdash;in Greenland, Alaska, Russia and the Baltic
States. It has likewise prevailed in the tropics when
the crops have failed. India has been conspicuous for its
large number of epidemics; some years ago scurvy
occurred in Arabia among the English troops stationed
at Aden, both among the British and the native troops.
A recent communication from Aruba, a small island of
Dutch Guiana, lying north of Venezuela, illustrates how
devastating scurvy still is in some parts of the world.
This account tells of 3000 cases of this disease which
occurred in 1915 among a population of less than 10,000,
owing to the fact that the crops had failed almost entirely
during the years 1912, 1913 and 1914.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 297px;">
<img src="images/fig_001.png" width="297" height="350" alt="Dependence on potato as antiscorbutic " />
<a id="Fig_1"></a><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;A comparison between the requisitioned quantity (in thousand pound units) of
potatoes and other vegetables, and the quantity received per month by an institution in
which more than 200 cases of scurvy occurred at the beginning of April, 1916. The total
height of column represents the amount needed and requisitioned; the solid black portion
the amount received. The number of inmates in the institution remained approximately
the same.<br />
<br />
The chart illustrates our great dependence on the potato during the winter months. This
is due not only to its intrinsic antiscorbutic potency, but, probably quite as much, to the
fact that fully twice as many pounds of potatoes are consumed during the winter as of all
other vegetables combined. Therefore, if this crop fails or is dehydrated, scurvy will develop
in the spring.
</div>

<p>It is important for us to realize that we are still dependent
on the annual crops for our protection from
scurvy; in other words, the world is leading a hand-to-mouth
existence in regard to its quota of antiscorbutic
food. The truth of this condition has been realized for
Ireland, sadly illustrated by numerous epidemics, notably
the great epidemic of 1847 reported by Curran. It was
demonstrated by the outbreaks of scurvy in Norway in
1904 and 1912, and was brought to the attention of many
in the United States in the spring of 1916. In this year
our potato crop fell far below the normal, with the result
that scurvy appeared in various parts of the United
States, especially in institutions (Fig. 1).<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span></p>
<p>The fact that scurvy may occur in any land and climate,
even in the garden spots of the world, is strikingly
shown by the epidemics reported from Algiers, and the
ravages of this disease among the gold seekers in California
in 1849. Nothing could be more incongruous than the
occurrence of a deficiency disease in this land of plenty.</p>

<p><b>Outbreaks at Sea.</b>&mdash;It is doubtful, however, whether
attention would have been focussed so early and so sharply
on scurvy, had it not been for the voyages of exploration
undertaken in the sixteenth century. These long trips
on sailing vessels, where for many months little or no fresh
vegetable or animal food was obtainable, were almost as
if designed to make a test of the dietetic origin of scurvy.
The result was inevitable&mdash;five to six months after the
ships were out of touch with land, the majority of the
crew frequently were incapacitated by this disease,
thereby wrecking many an expedition.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>The earliest account of the outbreak of scurvy at sea
is that of Vasco de Gama, who in 1497 discovered a passage
to the East Indies by way of the Cape of Good Hope.
The narratives of subsequent explorers, especially those
of Cartier and of Drake, are replete with descriptions of
the ravages of scurvy. The expedition of Lord Anson
in 1740 is always cited as a memorable example of an
undertaking which foundered as the result of scurvy.
After a cruise of four years, this expedition had lost from
this disease more than four out of five of the original
number of its crews. In striking contrast to this picture,
and to that furnished by the voyages of earlier navigators,
is that of Captain Cook, who in 1772 undertook a voyage<span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
lasting over three years, sailing from 52° north to 71°
south, with a loss of but one of his crew from disease,
and that not from scurvy. This remarkable feat, more
than any other, centered attention on the feasibility of
preventing scurvy, and resulted in measures tending to
eradicate it from the navy. Captain Cook attributed the
absence of scurvy among his crew to &ldquo;sweetwort,&rdquo; an
infusion of barley, which he prepared fresh and served
liberally. He also prized the antiscorbutic value
of sauerkraut.</p>

<p>We find accordingly in 1795, at the instance of Sir
Gilbert Blaine, that improvements were introduced in the
victualling of the fleet. As the result of a regular ration
of lemon juice, the incidence of scurvy fell precipitously.
It is due largely to this provision that between the years
1779 and 1813, according to the statistics of Sir Jay Barrow,
the morbidity and the mortality in the British Navy
was decreased by 75 per cent.</p>

<p>It has been shown that it took a generation after the efficacy of
antiscorbutics had been demonstrated in various expeditions, for an
antiscorbutic to be included in the ration of the navy. The merchant
marine of England was far more conservative, and for many years after
scurvy had been eradicated from the navy we still read of its occurrence
on the vessels making voyages to India, China and Ceylon. Gradually,
however, its incidence became less and less. Its toll of death, before
preventive measures were employed, may be appreciated from the fact that
it has been estimated that scurvy destroyed more sailors than all other
causes incidental to sea life, including the great slaughter of naval
warfare. Sir R. Hawkins stated in the latter part of the sixteenth
century that he could give an account of 10,000 mariners who had been<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>
destroyed by scurvy during the twenty years that he had been at sea.</p>

<p>As is well known, scurvy has played an important rôle in Arctic and
Antarctic explorations, and has been the cause of the failure of many of
these expeditions. It is now realized that the development of scurvy is
quite preventable, that if a sufficient quantity of meat (especially raw
meat) is consumed, explorers can be entirely independent of a supply of
fresh vegetables. This fact was brought out by the Arctic Survey
Committee (British), who &ldquo;were appointed to enquire into the
causes of the outbreak of scurvy in the recent Arctic expedition&rdquo;
(1877), and who reported that it may result from an absence of fresh
meat. That this conclusion was sound has been proved by the experiences
of Nansen and of Johansen, who wintered safely in Franz-Josefsland on a
diet of meat and bacon. More recently Stefánsson has carried out
successful Arctic explorations, depending entirely on fresh meat as
antiscorbutic foodstuff and making no provision whatsoever for vegetable
food.</p>

<p><b>Infantile Scurvy.</b>&mdash;Glisson, to whom we owe the first description of
rickets, likewise was the first to recognize scurvy in infants. In his
classic treatise on rickets, written in 1668, he writes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The scurvy is sometimes conjoyned with the affect. It is either
hereditary, or perhaps in so tender a constitution contracted by
infection, or lastly, it is produced from the indiscreet and erroneous
Regiment of the infant, and chiefly from the inclemency of the air and
climate where the child is educated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scurvy complicated with this affect hath these signs: 1. They
that labor under this affect do impatiently indure purgations; but they
who are only affected with<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
the Rachites do easily tolerate the same. 2. They are much offended with
violent exercises, neither can they at all endure them. But although in
this affect alone, there be a kind of slothfulness and aversation from
exercise, yet exercise doth not so manifestly, at least not altogether
so manifestly hurt them, as when the scurvy is conjoyned with the
Rachites. 3. Upon any concitated and vehement motion they draw not
breath without much difficulty, they are vexed with diverse pains
running through their joynts, and these they give warning of by theyr
crying, the motion of the Pulse is frequent and unequal, and somethimes
they are troubled with a Palpitation of the Heart, or threatened with a
Lypothymie, which Affects are for the most part soon mitigated, or
altogether appeased by laying them down to rest. 4. Tumours do very
commonly appear in the Gums. 5. The urin upon the absence of the
accustomed feavers is much more intense and increased.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Glisson&rsquo;s description of scurvy was entirely lost sight
of, overshadowed by his description of rickets, so that
for over two hundred years no word of infantile scurvy is
to be found either in the English or other literature.
There is no doubt that from time to time cases must have
occurred, but they were looked upon probably as rickets or
as a manifestation of one of the hemorrhagic diseases.</p>

<p>In 1859 Moeller described some cases which evidently were scurvy, but
which he termed &ldquo;acute rickets.&rdquo; He realized that they
presented a novel clinical picture but failed to recognize that they
represented a disorder quite distinct from rickets.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
This article was followed within<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
the next few years by reports of other German writers (Bohn, Steiner,
Foerster) who, accepting Moeller&rsquo;s point of view, considered these
cases merely as an acute form of rickets. They were led to this
erroneous conclusion chiefly on account of the lack of marked
involvement of the gums, which they considered an essential sign,
influenced by their conception of adult scurvy. This viewpoint has
pervaded the German literature even to the present day, when it is still
considered necessary to bring further evidence that infantile scurvy in
its pathogenesis and pathology is identical with adult scurvy.</p>

<p>In 1871 Ingerslev, an assistant of Hirschsprung in Copenhagen, wrote a
paper on &ldquo;A Case of Scurvy in a Child,&rdquo; which is quite
convincing. Two years later Jalland, an English physician, reported a
similar case of &ldquo;Scurvy in a Ten-Months-Old Infant.&rdquo; In 1878
Cheadle reported three cases of infantile scurvy with typical
tumefaction of the gums, and obscure tenderness of the legs, and
followed this paper by two others, which appeared in 1879 and 1882.
Cheadle clearly recognized the disease as scurvy. However, as the title
of his first paper&mdash;&ldquo;Three Cases of Scurvy Supervening on
Rickets in Young Children&rdquo;&mdash;indicates, he considered it a
condition engrafted upon rickets. About this time (1881) Gee presented a
brief but accurate account of five cases of scurvy which he termed
&ldquo;osteal or periosteal cachexia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1883, Barlow published his classical paper on this
subject, the first to furnish anatomical proof that this disorder
of infants presented the pathological changes characteristic
of adult scurvy. Previous to this publication
there had been but one autopsy report, that by Moeller,
which had been incorrectly interpreted. The work of
Barlow was accepted remarkably quickly in England and<span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
in America, but less promptly on the Continent. This
was probably due to the fact that infantile scurvy was
occurring far more frequently in these two countries, and
that the subject was open therefore to more prompt
investigation. This increased prevalence of infantile
scurvy in the two great English-speaking nations has
continued to the present time, and no doubt is due to
the extensive employment of artificial feeding and of proprietary
foods. In 1894 not less than 106 cases were reported
to the Academy of Medicine of New York City
by various physicians, and in 1898 the comprehensive
investigation of the American Pediatric Society appeared,
which was based on 379 cases.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that infantile scurvy occurred to
a greater or less degree throughout the civilized world. In
France, Monfalcon had reported a case in 1820 which is
sometimes referred to as the earliest case of infantile
scurvy mentioned in the literature. It relates, however,
to an older child and was published as a case of scorbutic
rickets. Netter was one of the first in France to recognize
the true nature of the disorder, and published several
papers in 1898 describing typical cases. Infantile scurvy
was, however, almost unknown in that country until what
is termed &ldquo;lait maternisé&rdquo; and &ldquo;lait fixé&rdquo; came into
vogue. This is apparent from a table prepared by
Lecornu, which gives a list of all cases in the French
literature between 1894 and 1904, and of the diets on
which they came about. The former of these milk preparations
is subjected to various manipulations and then
heated to a temperature above the boiling point; the latter
is shaken violently in a machine to render the fat globules
smaller, and is then sterilized by one of the usual methods.</p>

<p>Switzerland has undergone an experience similar to<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
that of France. Previous to 1903 only five cases of infantile
scurvy had been published from that country. In this
year Stoos published an additional five. In 1907 Bernheim-Karrer
reported nine cases, all of which had developed
on homogenized milk, a process very similar to that
employed by the French to break up the fat globules. The
increase of infantile scurvy in Switzerland may be judged
by the fact that a commission was formed in the following
year to investigate its occurrence.</p>

<p>In Germany there was for many years continued discussion
as to the true nature of scurvy. Some believed
it to be a form of rickets, others a form of scurvy; still
others a combination of scurvy and rickets. Some thought
it merely hereditary syphilis, and not many years ago
Naegeli looked upon it as an entity distinct from scurvy
on rickets. The subject attained additional importance
through an epidemic of infantile scurvy, which broke out
in Berlin in 1898, among infants who received milk from
one of the largest dairies. The episode led to prolonged
discussion in the Berlin Medical Society, and to several
excellent papers, among which that by Neumann deserves
particular mention.</p>

<p>The disorder has been reported in Holland by DeBruin,
who recorded numerous cases; in Denmark, by Hirschsprung,
who refused to recognize its scorbutic nature; in
Italy, by Concetti, and by others. It was not long before
there were reports of cases from almost every part of
the world, including Australia (Money) and East
India (Nichols).</p>

<p>In view of the fact that scurvy is endemic among
adults in Russia, we should also expect to find infantile
scurvy widespread in that country. In point of fact, quite
the contrary seems to be the case. In connection with the<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
great scurvy epidemic in Russia (1898&ndash;99), Tschudakoff
personally examined over 10,000 persons and found 11.11
per cent. of the people sick with this disease. He states
that in the course of this large experience he did not meet
with a single case under the age of five years. Fuerst
writes that Filatow, the great Russian children&rsquo;s specialist,
declared that he knew of no case of Barlow&rsquo;s disease
described in the Russian literature. This is not literally
correct, as Doepp described an epidemic of scurvy in the
St. Petersburg Foundling Asylum occurring in 1831. It
serves to emphasize, however, the paucity of cases among
infants in this great land of endemic adult scurvy. Lyabmow,
in referring to the scurvy in Kazan, tells us that
among 28,000 cases only a few infants were affected, and
Rauchfuss made the statement at the International Congress
at Copenhagen, in 1884, that although he had seen
a great many cases of scurvy, he had never seen it in
children one to two years of age. We shall not, in this
place, comment on this interesting and apparently paradoxical
situation, but shall have occasion to refer to it in
considering the pathogenesis. It may be added that in
Norway and Sweden, where scurvy is to some extent also
endemic among the adult population, there is a similar
lack of scurvy among infants.</p>

<p><b>Scurvy in the World War.</b>&mdash;The greatest advance in
medicine during the past generation has been in the fields
of hygiene and preventive medicine. One might therefore
have expected that the World War would have differed
from previous wars in a notable absence of scurvy among
the troops and the civilian population. This is true to a
limited degree only. Reports which have been published
in the course of the war, and especially since hostilities
have ceased, show that the troops who were incapacitated<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
by scurvy must have numbered many thousands. As was
to be expected, scurvy occurred most often in Russia,
where it is endemic. The largest number of cases was
reported by Boerich, who as director of a Red Cross
Central Station in Russia saw 1343 cases. Other German
physicians who had charge of caring for the Russian
prisoners give accounts of the occurrence of some hundreds
of cases of scurvy. An article by Much and Baumbach
gains added interest from the novel suggestion that
scurvy is transmitted by means of vermin. That scurvy
must have reached large proportions is shown by the fact
that in July, 1916, a medical commission was sent by the
Germans to investigate the scurvy in a Russian army
corps, and that it was necessary to establish for this disease
in every division a sanatorium comprising 100 beds.
Hoerschelman, who wrote an account of this investigation,
blames the bad hygienic surroundings, the lack of sleep,
the overexertion, as well as the deficiency of food, for the
occurrence of the epidemic. As usual, very few cases
occurred among officers. He describes a number of instances
where scurvy was feigned by rubbing the gums
and making them bleed, or by irritating them with the
juice of tobacco. These reports on scurvy in Russia bring
us little new from a purely medical standpoint. They
emphasize the occurrence of night-blindness as an early
and frequent symptom. It is difficult to judge whether this
manifestation was due entirely to the scurvy, or was in
part the result of other deficiencies in the diet. For instance,
Hift states that the night-blindness was cured by
cod liver oil, or by the water in which beef liver had been
cooked. This would point rather to a deficiency of the
fat-soluble vitamine, as these substances could have little
effect in curing scurvy. The cases reported by Wassermann,<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
where neuritic pains in the legs played a considerable
rôle, evidently are also not simple scurvy, but
may well be the result of more than one food deficiency
or a complicating ostitis. In the same way some reports
show clearly that &ldquo;hunger edema&rdquo; complicated scurvy.</p>

<p>Scurvy occurred next in frequency among the nations
neighboring Russia. Speyer tells us that a German sanitary
commission was sent to Bulgaria largely with the
object of investigating scurvy in that country. The
excellent monograph on the pathology of scurvy just
written by Aschoff and Koch was founded on an experience
in Roumania among Turkish, German and Austrian
soldiers. Added to its other woes the Servian army was
visited by scurvy. Wiltshire gives us a description of
this disease based on an observation of 3000 cases in the
first half of the year 1917. In regard to scurvy in this
part of the world, Morawitz writes that when he reached
Roumania he was surprised to find scurvy the most prevalent
disease in the army, and that since the spring of 1917
it was widely disseminated among the German troops.
Lobmeyer writes of scurvy among the Turkish troops,
and Disqué reports 500 cases among prisoners captured
in Turkestan.</p>

<p>Along the Western front very few cases are described.
There is an account by Korbsch of 51 cases in this area in
1915. Schreiber describes 30 cases among the German
prisoners of war captured in the beginning of 1917, which
were diagnosed as purpuric rheumatism. Arneth recounts
that sporadic cases of scurvy occurred among the German
troops, especially among the older soldiers, and that in
many cases this was combined with the hunger edema.
He attributes the scurvy to a dependence on dehydrated
vegetables in the ration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span></p>

<p>From all these accounts it is evident that scurvy played
an important rôle in the general nutrition of the troops
on the Eastern front. Probably it was of the latent
variety, which is exceedingly difficult to diagnose, but
which increases the susceptibility to infection, and intensifies
the severity of all medical or surgical diseases. Von
Niedner takes this point of view, stating that although
scurvy had been largely prevented in this war, the obscure
rudimentary type had not been eradicated. He remarks
upon a fact, noted in our Civil War and other wars, that
under these conditions eruptions assume a hemorrhagic
character in typhoid fever, cerebrospinal fever, rheumatism
and other infections. Pick made a similar observation
at a medical meeting in Vienna in reference to scurvy
in the Austrian army, drawing attention to the hemorrhagic
diathesis existing among the troops and expressing
the opinion that scurvy was occurring in this war as in
previous wars.</p>

<p>Very little scurvy seems to have broken out among the
British troops in Europe. Thirty-two cases were reported
as occurring in the middle of 1915 at a divisional rest
station in France. It made marked inroads, however, on
the health of the Colonial troops in Mesopotamia. In the
report of the Mesopotamia Commission we read that 7500
men were lost to the force in 19 weeks as a result of
scurvy, and that this happened in the summer of 1916
although additions had been made to the ration in the
previous spring. A conception of the extent of the scurvy
may be formed from the accompanying table, published
by Willcox:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span></p>
<p>It will be noted that thousands of cases occurred
among the Indian troops. This was due to the fact
that the British ate more potatoes and fresh meat.
In his official report of the outbreak of scurvy among
Indian troops, Colonel Hehir writes: &ldquo;The only vegetable
now allowed is 2 ounces of potatoes and the only fresh
meat 28 ounces a week. It is very doubtful whether this
authorized ration, if not supplemented by other vegetables
and more meat, is sufficient to prevent scurvy.&rdquo; In the
account which this officer gives of the medical conditions
during the siege of Kut-el-Amara, it is stated that there
were 1050 admissions for scurvy, fully developed, incipient
and latent. It is remarked that those Indians who ate
horseflesh were decidedly less affected. From the fact
that special hospitals for scurvy were established in June,
1916, at Bagdad, Amora and Basrah, it is evident that a
large number of cases must have been encountered. Most
significant in this connection, however, are the preventive
measures which were instituted by the British government.
A body of 256 men, designated as the Madras
Gardener&rsquo;s Corps, were dispatched to Mesopotamia to
plant gardens all over the country and to supply packets
of seeds to various units. At Bagdad alone their output
of vegetables was over 400,000 pounds. This certainly
constitutes a remarkable innovation in the hygiene
of armies.</p>

<p>The French army was not entirely spared from scurvy.
In 1917 Harvier, an army surgeon, was surprised to discover
that 95 per cent. of the 800 troops of which he had
charge suffered from scurvy; he tells us that other epidemic
centres were recognized later outside this sector.
Elsewhere we read of the occurrence of scurvy in France,
involving 40 per cent. of the 1700 men of the South African<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
Labor Corps, and that this disorder was still more serious
in another company owing to the fact that it was not
recognized (Dyke).<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Benoit reported 63 cases which he
discovered in 1917 among 300 laborers. According to his
account, all these laborers received the same food, and
those with scurvy recovered quite independently of any
change in the dietary.</p>

<p>There are many accounts of scurvy among the Italian
troops. Vannutelli gives a description of an epidemic
of some 200 cases of infectious purpura with manifestations
of hemorrhagic scurvy. Another writer informs us
that in June, 1916, scurvy broke out among some Italian
troops stationed at an altitude of 1500 to 2000 metres
(Gingui). Vallardi gives an account of 180 cases among
Italian troops in Macedonia, accompanied by slight jaundice
and enlargement of the glands.</p>

<p>The American soldiers seem to have been practically
spared from scurvy. This was due probably to their
ample ration and to the fact that they were in the field
for a comparatively short period. The Surgeon-General&rsquo;s
report to date, which has been kindly furnished me, showed
but 5 cases in 1917 occurring in Europe and the United
States, and but 15 cases reported during the year 1918.</p>

<p><i>The civilian population</i> of the various warring countries
was by no means spared. There are no reports
from Russia to indicate the extent of scurvy, but from
what is known of the food conditions prevailing there<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
toward the end of the war, one can be certain that the
number must have been large. The greatest amount of
scurvy has been reported from Austria, more particularly
from Vienna. Previous to the war scurvy was a rare
disease in this city, both among adults and infants. During
the war, however, as the result of a lack of fresh food
and the dependence on dehydrated vegetables, a large
number of cases developed. Tobler reports over 200 cases
in children between the ages of two and fifteen years,
which occurred in 1917 in child-caring institutions where
the milk supply was markedly deficient, where fresh vegetables
were lacking, and the supply of potatoes gave out
about Christmas, 1916. A conception of the deficiency
of the milk supply may be gained from the statement that
there were but sixteen quarts a day for about 1500 people.
Some of these children were undergoing fresh-air treatment
and were out of doors in the &ldquo;sun stations&rdquo; day and
night. For the cure of these children a simple decoction
of fir-tops was used, a therapeutic procedure stated by
Lind to have been of value in the Russo-Swedish War
of 1708.</p>

<p>That scurvy must have occurred extensively among
the infants in Vienna may be gathered from the report of
Erdheim, who records 31 autopsies on infants under the
interesting title of the &ldquo;Barlow Heart.&rdquo; In Berlin scurvy
occurred also in the foundling asylums, as reported by
Eric Mueller and by Brandt. This was caused by a diet
of pasteurized milk and dehydrated vegetables. In an
article bearing the suggestive title of &ldquo;On a Marked Increase
in Barlow&rsquo;s Disease in the Years of the War
1917&ndash;1918,&rdquo; Epstein states that in Prague there had been
an endemic increase of infantile scurvy since August, 1917.
The only information regarding scurvy among the adult<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
civilian population of Germany is that furnished by
Morawitz, who states that this disorder occurred sporadically.
Here again it is probable that there were many
latent or rudimentary cases which were not recognized.</p>

<p>In Great Britain there are reports which show that
scurvy manifested itself in institutions caring for the
poor. In Glasgow we learn of 50 cases developing in the
Poor Law Hospital in the course of fifteen months, and
in Newcastle of 16 cases appearing in the Poor Law
Infirmary in the course of three months.</p>

<p>It is probable that when more detailed reports are
available, it will be found that there was far more scurvy
than was appreciated during the course of the war. It
will be impossible, however, to gain even an approximate
knowledge of the extent to which this disorder prevailed,
as in many instances it was inextricably interwoven with
other nutritional diseases. The situation which Enright
describes in Cairo among the Turkish prisoners suffering
from war edema, where there was &ldquo;evidently a scorbutic
factor involved,&rdquo; probably held true for many other
parts of the world. War and scurvy must still be regarded
as associated evils, for war is closely linked with famine
and food deprivation&mdash;the dominant factor in the production
of scurvy.</p>

<h2><span class="fs85">CHAPTER II</span><br />

PATHOGENESIS AND ETIOLOGY</h2>


<p>At the outset it may be stated that there is no longer
any reason to doubt that adult scurvy and infantile scurvy
are one and the same disease, having an identical pathogenesis.
For many years, far longer than the facts warranted,
there was discussion whether Barlow&rsquo;s disease
was true scurvy or merely a form or a complication of
rickets, or perhaps a distinct hemorrhagic disease. This
question may be relegated to the past, so that we may
proceed to consider the pathogenesis of scurvy in the
infant and in the adult under a common heading.</p>

<p>There is no need of studying all the theories which
have been advanced to account for scurvy. They have
been manifold and most of them have died a natural death.
For many years the <i>potassium deficiency theory</i>, suggested
by Garrod, gained wide acceptance. That scurvy
should be attributed to a lack of this salt is readily comprehensible
in view of the abundance of potassium in the
antiscorbutic foodstuffs, the fruits and the vegetables.
It was not long before it was evident that this was not
the correct solution, as the salts of potassium served
neither to prevent nor to cure scurvy. This theory was
accordingly modified to include only organic potassium.
Experiment, however, failed to support the validity of this
hypothesis, and it was gradually abandoned.</p>

<p>Another theory which had a short but popular career
was the <i>citric acid theory</i>, which was maintained vigorously
by Netter. This explanation seemed logical in view
of the marked potency of the citrous fruits, and particularly<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
when it was shown that human milk contains a
greater percentage of the salts of citric acid than cow&rsquo;s
milk, and that some of these salts are lost in the course
of heating. This hypothesis withstood neither the practical
test nor chemical investigation. It was found that the
various salts of citric acid, either singly or in combination,
are unable to cure scurvy. This treatment has been employed
repeatedly on man and on animals with little or
no success; we also have resorted to it in vain. It was
shown, furthermore, that it rested on an insecure chemical
basis, as boiled milk contains but 0.1 g. per litre less citric
acid than raw milk&mdash;an amount which is negligible from
a therapeutic point of view.</p>

<p>Before considering what may be termed the prevailing
theories, a few lines must be devoted to the <i>acidosis theory</i>
championed by Sir Almroth Wright. According to this
writer scurvy is due primarily to an excess of acid compared
with alkaline food.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> A theory of this nature was
open to verification, and soon collapsed when put to the
test. It was found, in the first place, that an addition of
alkali was unable to cure experimental scurvy. It may
be added that we have found it of no value in infantile
scurvy. Holst and Froelich pointed out that potatoes
and peas, two excellent antiscorbutic vegetables, have an
alkaline and not an acid ash; that adding hydrochloric
acid to dandelion juice improves rather than diminishes its
potency; that 1 g. of cabbage, which suffices to protect
a guinea-pig from scurvy, does not contain sufficient alkali
to neutralize an acid state; and, finally, that scurvy<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
is not encountered in the well-established acidosis
of diabetes.</p>

<p>Let us turn to some of the current theories of the
etiology of scurvy. For years many have held to the <i>toxic
theory</i>, believing that poisons either were consumed in the
food or formed in the intestine by means of bacterial action.
At present this view is held by the minority. The
situation in this respect may be compared to that of beriberi,
about which there is also no consensus of opinion,
a minority attributing it to the action of an unknown toxin.</p>

<p>A consideration of the clinical course of scurvy sheds
but little light on this aspect, and can be interpreted as well
for as against the action of a toxin. The nervous system,
which is well known to be particularly vulnerable to toxins,
is but slightly affected&mdash;the cardiorespiratory phenomena
(indicating an involvement of the pneumogastric nerves),
the occasional changes in the optic disks, and the abnormality
of the tendon reflexes constitute the aggregate. In
a general way it may be stated that the symptoms resemble
those brought about by poisons of various kinds&mdash;the
cottonseed poisoning in swine, the toxic products of the
wheat embryo, or even mercurial poisoning in man.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> The
nervous symptoms, especially the irritability of the heart,
remind one of the enterogenous intoxication or enterotoxic
polyneuritis described by Von Noorden. Such analogies
are interesting and suggestive, but can be accorded
little weight in deciding the question at issue.</p>

<p>If a toxin is to be regarded as the proximate cause of<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
infantile scurvy, the question naturally arises as to the
nature of the toxin. Is it exogenous or endogenous?
There is sound basis for believing that the hypothetical
poison is not introduced preformed in the food. In the
first place, infantile scurvy frequently develops in babies
who receive milk of the very best grade indeed, in contradistinction
to rickets, this is not preëminently a disease
of the poor. Furthermore, there is no relation between
the concentration of the food mixture and its liability to
induce scurvy. For example, if among a large number
of infants receiving pasteurized milk from a common
source, some are given the milk diluted by one-half, others
given it diluted by one-third, and still others whole milk,
the last group will show the least tendency to scurvy,
which we should not expect were the poison contained
in the food. Nor is it at all uncommon to encounter scurvy
in an infant which has been fed with a very dilute milk
mixture. Another side of this question should, however,
be mentioned&mdash;stale pasteurized milk is more apt to produce
scurvy than the freshly pasteurized, but here again
the injury is in inverse ratio rather than in direct ratio to
the amount consumed. There are reports of adult scurvy
having been occasioned by decomposed food, such as
Torup&rsquo;s investigation of Nansen&rsquo;s polar expedition, but
the diet had not been faultless in other respects. The
experiments of Jackson and Harley, who produced scurvy
in monkeys by feeding tainted tinned meat, cannot be unreservedly
accepted, as they are substantiated by no
pathological examination of the bones, and the diarrh&oelig;a
and the blood and mucus in the stools do not suggest simple
scurvy.</p>

<p>Of those who held to the toxic origin of scurvy the
majority had in mind an endogenous toxin, although the<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
conception of the nature of this poison varied greatly.
The minority report of the American Pediatric Society
states that &ldquo;scurvy appears to be a chronic ptomaine poisoning
due to the absorption of toxins.&rdquo; Neumann considered
scurvy a chronic poisoning, formed probably from
the albumin of the milk, and considered the fact that the infant
refused to take the harmful food as weighty evidence
of its toxic nature. Kohlbrugge included scurvy in his
group of &ldquo;fermentive diseases,&rdquo; due to the overgrowth
of harmful bacteria in the intestine, which are normally
restrained by the acid reaction of the chyme. McCollum
and Pitz, on the basis of a study of experimental scurvy,
suggested that as the result of a break in the metabolism
it might be due to the retention of fæces and consequent
absorption of toxins. Still more recently Gerstenberger
suggested that as the result of the break in the metabolism
of carbohydrates, a defunctioning substance, possibly
oxalic acid, is produced, which has a strong affinity
for calcium.</p>

<p>It is of no avail to discuss these various hypotheses&mdash;the
formation of intestinal toxins&mdash;except where they are
based on observations which can be tested and controlled.
This is true solely of <i>the relation of constipation to scurvy</i>,
and we shall confine ourselves therefore to a consideration
of this aspect of the question.</p>

<p>There can be no question whether retention of fæces of
itself can bring about scurvy; this is excluded by the
marked instances of constipation frequently encountered
among thriving babies. The majority of bottle-fed babies
and a large number of the breast-fed suffer from a greater
or less degree of constipation. On looking over our records
of infantile scurvy from this point of view, and comparing
them with non-scorbutic infants, we have not<span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
been able to note a characteristic distinction. Some of the
infants had normal stools, others suffered from constipation,
while the records of a great number showed occasional
loose stools. Furthermore, in cases of latent or
subacute infantile scurvy, it was of no moment whether a
laxative was given or whether constipation was induced
by means of opium. The report of the American Pediatric
Society shows that the majority have had a similar experience;
the bowels were regular in seventy-four instances,
irregular in fifteen, constipated in one hundred
and twenty-six, and diarrh&oelig;al in seventy-seven. In this
connection, it may be pointed out that the preparation
termed &ldquo;malt soup,&rdquo; the diet which in our experience has
been most frequently associated with scurvy, is essentially
laxative, and, on the other hand, that one of the most
potent antiscorbutics is potato, which has no definite laxative
property. It may be added, as noted elsewhere, that
scurvy developed in infants in spite of their receiving cod
liver oil or olive oil for long periods. It is evident, therefore,
that the retention of fæces is not the essential factor
in the etiology of scurvy. Its secondary rôle, especially
after scurvy has developed, will be considered later in
this chapter.</p>

<p>In order to elucidate this question Torrey and Hess
made a study of the relation of the intestinal flora to the
scurvy of guinea-pigs and of infants. In guinea-pigs they
found in the intestinal tract merely such bacteria as are
encountered on the oats and hay fed these animals. The
bacteria were few in number and hardly any were actively
proteolytic. Furthermore, there was no change in the
flora on adding antiscorbutic food, although the scorbutic
symptoms disappeared. Recently Givens and Hoffman,
as the result of a similar study, have come to the same<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
conclusion. The investigation of infants led to similar
results, and is illustrated in Table 1. It will be seen
that the infants were all on a high carbohydrate diet, and
that in two instances the flora was compared, not only
during the active scorbutic process, but after orange juice
had been given for a week or more. The bacteria were
such as one should expect on a diet rich in carbohydrates;
putrefactive organisms were present only in small numbers;
and in the case in which they were most numerous
(S), they had disappeared upon the subsequent examination,
although the scurvy had become more marked. It is
evident, therefore, that in the scurvy of infants as well
as of guinea-pigs there is no overgrowth of putrefactive
bacteria in the intestinal tract, and therefore no basis
for the hypothesis of ptomaine or similar intoxication.
Other poisons may, however, be absorbed from the intestine
as the result of a prolonged deprivation of an essential
vitamine.</p>

<p>There are those who believe that scurvy is of <i>bacterial
origin</i>, some going so far as to regard it as a communicable
disease. This viewpoint was maintained by the
famous Boerhaave and supported with all the weight of
his authority by Villemin in the seventeenth century. It
is a view held by many, if not by the majority, of physicians
in Russia to-day, and recently has been advanced
by European army surgeons. This question illustrates
in an interesting manner how the trend of the day influences
medical thought&mdash;it has been suggested lately by
Much and Baumbach that the scurvy microörganism may
be carried by means of lice. But clinical experience points
absolutely against the infectious nature of scurvy. Indeed,
the only episode which lends any support to this
opinion is its widespread and seemingly epidemic character;<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
the fallacy of such deductions has been well illustrated
in regard to beriberi, which for many years was regarded
as an infectious and communicable disease. The fact that
whenever scurvy occurs among a body of troops the officers
are spared, constitutes convincing evidence against
its communicability. This peculiarity of incidence was
noted by Hoerschelman and others in the recent World
War, and is referred to in the Report of the War of the
Rebellion. Many of the earlier writers, in discussing
the occurrence of ship scurvy, drew attention to the paucity
of cases among the officers.</p>

<p>When we turn to bacteriological studies we find that
some years ago Ausset claimed to have isolated &ldquo;a pasteurella
type of organism&rdquo; from a case of infantile scurvy,
and suggested it as the causative agent of this disorder.
On the other hand, Hart, Rehn, Hirschsprung, von Starck,
Schmorl, and recently Boerich, have failed to find bacteria
in the blood, although the total number of cultures must be
admitted to have been small. Czerny and Keller report
negative bacterial growth from fluid aspirated from
affected joints.</p>

<p>The only articles considering this important question
from the experimental side are those of Jackson and
Moody, and of Moore, who conclude tentatively that
scurvy may be a bacterial infection. Jackson and Moody
cultivated a diplococcus from the tissues of scorbutic
animals after death, reproduced hemorrhages by inoculating
cultures of these microörganisms into the circulation,
and recovered the bacteria from the tissues some
weeks later. Their results are open to the criticism that
bacteria were found only after death, and that all blood
cultures during life proved negative. An article by
Moore, however, which has just appeared from this same<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
laboratory, states that &ldquo;an organism of the streptococcus
viridans type was isolated from the blood&rdquo; in a
case of adult scurvy. In one instance we recovered an
organism of this type from the blood of an infant suffering
from scurvy. It is highly important that more blood
cultures should be carried out in the course of human
or animal scurvy, and that particular note should be
made of the stage of the disorder when they are taken.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that invasion of the blood-stream
does occur readily in the course of scurvy, but this takes
place generally after the disease has developed and must
be regarded as a secondary phenomenon and therefore
unessential from an etiologic standpoint. Indeed one of
the striking and important symptoms of scurvy is the
marked susceptibility to infection (furunculosis, nasal
diphtheria, &ldquo;grippe,&rdquo; etc.), which comes about as the
result of the nutritional disturbance. An excellent example
of this interrelationship is the &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo; of hemorrhagic
scurvy described in the chapter on symptomatology.
Hemorrhages coming about in this way should be
regarded as focal complications rather than as truly scorbutic.
It should be realized that, at the present time,
it is not possible to distinguish between local symptoms
which are truly nutritional or scorbutic in nature, and
those which are bacterial and of secondary origin.</p>

<p>The newest theory, and the one at present most widely
accepted, is the <i>vitamine</i> (<i>accessory factor</i>) <i>theory</i>. It
was evident to Lind in the seventeenth century that scurvy
could be prevented and cured by means of fruits or vegetables,
a fact which became increasingly clear to succeeding
generations. Until the latter part of the nineteenth century,
however, this miraculous virtue of plants stimulated
little inquiry and no research. As far back as 1841 Budd<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
realized that &ldquo;the explanation depended on the study
of organic chemistry, and the experiments of physiologists,&rdquo;
but until recently it was not perceived that the
solution of the problem involved the introduction of a new
chemical factor. This view suddenly took shape after
Eijkman in 1897 showed the nature of polyneuritis in fowl,
and Hopkins in 1906, going a step farther, demonstrated
the necessity of one or more unidentified food factors for
the normal nutrition of the rat. The work which established
this novel theory on a scientific basis in relation to
scurvy was the classic investigation of Holst and Froelich,
referred to so frequently in connection with experimental
scurvy. These investigators showed that the mere drying
of vegetables was sufficient to deprive them of their antiscorbutic
power, although from a chemical standpoint they
seemed unaltered; that high degrees of heat had generally
the same effect; that under certain conditions these foods
withstood prolonged heating, demonstrating that the antiscorbutic
factor was not a ferment; that acids and alkalies
played no essential rôle in the etiology; that fats, proteins
and carbohydrates were not significant factors; that as
little as 1.0 g. of cabbage suffices to afford protection to a
guinea-pig. In other words, by a process of exclusion
they showed that it is a disorder due to the lack of an
unidentified food factor.</p>

<p>Subsequent studies, carried out within the past few
years, have served only to strengthen this viewpoint. For
example, an &ldquo;artificial orange juice&rdquo; composed of the
various salts, citric acid, and sucrose in the proportions
in which they are found in the natural juice, failed, in the
experience of Hess and Unger, to protect or to cure
guinea-pigs&mdash;demonstrating that this preparation did not
contain the essential factor. In the same way, Harden and<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
Zilva were able to protect animals from scurvy with a
preparation of lemon juice which had been almost entirely
deprived of its salts. It is needless to multiply these
examples. It is sufficient to state that there has been
no investigation during the last years of intensive study
of scurvy, which has tended to weaken the vitamine
hypothesis. It may be stated, therefore, that experiments
have demonstrated that scurvy is due essentially to the
lack of a specific vitamine. It is unwise to proceed farther
and place it in the group of so-called &ldquo;deficiency
diseases,&rdquo; including beriberi, pellagra, etc., unless the
reservation is made that these several diseases may present
marked differences. It is quite possible that one
may be what might be termed a simple deficiency disease,
whereas another may have important additional etiologic
factors. At any rate, unless it is realized that there has
been no proof that all are due to similar deficiencies, we
may, by stamping them all alike and by grouping them
together, be misled into taking their close relationship for
granted. In regard to scurvy, there may well be other
etiologic factors, but they are of a secondary character.
Bacterial invasion has been referred to in this connection,
and it is possible that toxins are absorbed from the intestine
after nutrition has been disturbed. Diarrh&oelig;a and
digestive disturbances may play a rôle. Whether the
total intake of food or the correlation of its constituents&mdash;protein,
carbohydrate, fat and salts&mdash;affects the action
of the vitamine, is one which has not been well studied
clinically or experimentally. In regard to beriberi, it is
claimed that there is a direct ratio between the quantity of
carbohydrate ingested and the amount of vitamine required.
No such interrelationship exists in regard to
scurvy. This was evident a few years ago (1917) when<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
some infants receiving pasteurized milk, prepared with
the addition of 3 per cent. flour, did not tend to develop
scurvy more readily than others receiving simple pasteurized
milk. A consideration of the antiscorbutic vitamine
will be postponed for a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p><b>Etiology.</b>&mdash;In considering infantile scurvy we are concerned
almost entirely with the artificially-fed baby. It is
true that in the literature we meet with scattered reports
of <i>scurvy in breast-fed babies</i> and that these cases seem
to constitute a noteworthy group; in point of fact, they
are comparatively few. The collective investigation of
the American Pediatric Society includes ten infants who
had been given breast milk exclusively, and Concetti adds
another ten in his compilation of 682 cases.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> In spite
of their paucity these cases require separate consideration
because they represent an important aspect from
an etiologic standpoint. How are we to explain the
fact that human milk may lead to rather than protect
against this disorder? On investigating more
closely it is found that these cases differ in several
important respects from the group which has been artificially
fed. They are of a different age; instead of being
in the second half year of life they are generally but a
few months old. Furthermore, the signs are not the same.
The hemorrhages involve the upper extremities fully as
frequently as the lower extremities, and often appear at
unusual sites&mdash;for example, on the scalp or as large subcutaneous
effusions at various parts of the body. In
many instances it has been noted that the nursing mothers
were suffering from some debilitating disease such as<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
tuberculosis or syphilis, or had an insufficient supply of
milk, or that there had been some other unusual factor,
as Freund has shown in an article devoted to this particular
aspect. It is not necessary, however, to fall back
on these attendant circumstances to exclude from consideration
many of the cases. For example, Crandall&rsquo;s
case of &ldquo;scurvy in an infant of six weeks&rdquo; should be invalidated,
not because, as Freund suggests, the mother had
rheumatism and insufficient milk, but because of the age
of the infant, and the course of the disease; first one arm
was involved, then the other, then hemorrhages appeared
on the skin, and finally it was cured by giving a teaspoonful
of fresh cream before each nursing. Had the baby
really suffered from scurvy it could not have been cured by
this means. Southgate&rsquo;s case must also be rejected, not
because the mother was tuberculous but in view of the
symptoms&mdash;the arms and legs were pseudoparetic, &ldquo;the
legs, feet and hands were double their normal size,&rdquo; and
moderately large hemorrhages were present on the back
and chest. It seems hardly necessary to discuss in detail
the score of cases which comprise this group, as, in general,
the same criticism applies to all. Some evidently
were congenital syphilis, still more must be regarded as
sepsis, and others as unknown toxic conditions. Apart
from these cases the question must be considered whether
scurvy can occur in a breast-fed infant. Personally, we
have never met with a case of this kind, and, as Finkelstein
aptly remarks, there has been &ldquo;no necropsy of a
breast-fed case or conclusive X-ray picture.&rdquo; It seems
possible only if an infant, for a period of months, has
obtained a scanty supply of milk, or when the milk has
been exceedingly deficient in the antiscorbutic vitamine.<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
Even under such conditions it does not seem possible for
scurvy to become manifest in six weeks (Crandall&rsquo;s case),
or in four weeks, as in a case reported by the American
Pediatric Society, unless we believe that the infant suffered
also from a certain degree of intrapartum or congenital
scurvy. In view of the fact that an infant
requires about one pint of milk to furnish it with an adequate
daily quota of the antiscorbutic factor, it is theoretically
possible, under extreme conditions, for it to
become scorbutic, in spite of being nursed at the breast.
Such an occurrence must be regarded as exceedingly rare,
far more so than the current statistics illustrate, for considerably
less than a pint of milk a day will prevent the
appearance of manifest scurvy for a period of several
months. Some of the reported cases may have been
latent scurvy, rendered acute by a complicating bacterial
infection.</p>

<p>It might be expected that by ascertaining <i>the occurrence
of infantile scurvy in countries where it is endemic</i>,
we could learn under what conditions and how frequently
breast-fed babies develop this disorder. Approaching the
question from this angle, it is found that the available data
is meagre and not entirely convincing. Peculiarly enough
infantile scurvy has rarely been reported from Russia,
where scurvy is, in many sections, endemic. For example,
although Tschudakoff, who personally examined over
10,000 persons, in connection with the great scurvy epidemic
in Russia (1898&ndash;99) found 11.11 per cent. of the people
suffering from this disease, he did not meet with a
single case under the age of five years. Fuerst writes that
Filatow, the celebrated Russian children&rsquo;s specialist, declared
that he knew of no instance of Barlow&rsquo;s disease<span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
described in the Russian literature.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Shortly after the
recent war scurvy broke out among the wet-nurses in an
infant asylum in Vienna. A very few of the infants nursed
by these women developed the disorder, far fewer than
might have been expected (personal communication).
Hopkins recently wrote a communication to the effect that
in the island of Aruba, in the Dutch West Indies, they had
been unable to grow any crops in 1912, 1913, 1914, that
3000 cases of scurvy had developed there during the year
1915, and that in 1917 it was again being noted. In answer
to a personal inquiry regarding the occurrence of scurvy
among the infants of Aruba, he wrote that &ldquo;infantile
scurvy is very rare,&rdquo; although &ldquo;most all of the babies are
breast-fed for about a year.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, descriptions of the coincidence
of scurvy in mother and nursling are even more fragmentary;
in fact, we have been able to find but two reports
of this kind. The one most frequently cited is that of
Cheadle, which consists merely of the following bald statement:
&ldquo;With the exception of one or two doubtful cases,
of which the details of breast-feeding and diet are imperfectly
given, the only instances of scurvy arising in sucklings
are those when the nursing mother has been
suffering from scurvy at the time.&rdquo; The other report
has been gleaned from a recent editorial in the <i>British
Medical Journal</i>, which refers to the above mentioned outbreak
of scurvy in Vienna, affecting in some cases both
mothers and breast-fed infants.</p>

<p>It is difficult to pass judgment on this question in view<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
of the paucity of data. In the near future, probably, when
we learn in detail about the epidemics of scurvy which
occurred during and immediately following the war, we
shall be in a better position to weigh its pros and cons.
In view of the above data it does not seem that nursing
infants readily develop scurvy, even though their mothers
do not obtain a full quota of antiscorbutic vitamine in their
food. This appears to be the clinical result, whatever its
interpretation may be. It cannot be explained on the
assumption that human milk contains a particularly large
quota of this factor. In a test carried out to elucidate this
question it was found that eight ounces a day of breast
milk was insufficient to alleviate the symptoms in a case
of scurvy, and that twelve ounces barely sufficed. This
milk was from a woman who was on a liberal diet containing
an adequate supply of vegetables. It had been previously
demonstrated that sixteen ounces of cow&rsquo;s milk
is sufficient to cure infantile scurvy, so that it is evident
that human and cow&rsquo;s milk do not differ essentially in this
respect. There are, however, other factors to be considered&mdash;for
example, the incomparable freshness of the
milk suckled from the breast, which may endow it with
additional potency, or the possibility that the lack of
vitamine may be compensated for by the large quantity
of milk consumed. It also may not be entirely immaterial
whether the vitamine is supplied in one dose, as, for example
a daily feeding of orange or tomato juice, or whether
this factor is furnished to the infant in frequent small
quantities in the mother&rsquo;s milk throughout the day. In
this connection we cannot help contrasting the relation of
beriberi to breast feeding. As is well known, infants
which develop beriberi are almost always nursed and not
bottle-fed, and show signs of this disorder, although the<span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>
mothers are in apparent health, and give no clinical evidence
of disease.</p>

<p>Turning to a consideration of <i>the artificially-fed infant</i>,
there exists a somewhat similar situation in regard to the
occurrence of scurvy on a diet of raw cow&rsquo;s milk. In
almost all reports of this kind the quantitative viewpoint
is entirely disregarded, and little or nothing is stated to
indicate how much milk the infant consumed. And yet this
factor is of essential importance in interpreting the cause
of the nutritional failure. It is clear, for example, that
if a baby receives but eight ounces daily of raw milk&mdash;one-half
the requisite amount&mdash;it may well develop scurvy,
notwithstanding the fact that the milk has not been heated.
In addition to the quantity, there are other factors which
play a greater or less rôle in the relation of raw milk to the
etiology of scurvy. It is no doubt of consequence whether
the fodder of the cows was rich or very poor in the antiscorbutic
factor, and, accordingly, whether the baby received
what may be termed an &ldquo;antiscorbutic-rich&rdquo; or an
&ldquo;antiscorbutic-poor&rdquo; milk. Furthermore, the age of the
milk must be borne in mind, for we have found that even
raw milk loses some of its potency on becoming stale.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>One of the mooted questions relative to the etiology of
scurvy is the rôle of heated milk, and more particularly
of <i>pasteurized milk</i>. In view of the vogue which pasteurization
has acquired in the large municipalities, especially
in the United States, this aspect has assumed
increasing importance, and deserves detailed investigation.
Pasteurization has achieved so much in limiting the<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
infectious diseases, especially the diarrh&oelig;al disorders of
infancy, that it has come to be looked upon as heresy to
deprecate its virtues in any regard.</p>

<p>It has become increasingly evident that in the course
of pasteurization milk loses an important measure of antiscorbutic
vitamine. The term pasteurization, when employed
in this connection, is not meant to be synonymous
merely with the heating of milk to 140° to 165° F., but
embraces the entire commercial process&mdash;the heating,
handling, subsequent cooling, aging and all other factors
involved. There can be no doubt that milk which has
undergone this elaborate treatment has suffered in its antiscorbutic
property. In 1914 Hess and Fish reported mild
cases of scurvy occurring among infants who had received
milk heated to a temperature of 165° F. for thirty minutes.
This degree of heat is claimed by many physicians and
hygienists, including the National Commission on Milk
Standards, not to destroy its chemical constituents.
Nevertheless typical cases of scurvy supervened after this
diet had been followed for a period of six to nine months.
Subsequent experience, published by Hess in 1917, with
milk heated to only 145° F., served to confirm the previous
observations. That these cases were true scurvy was
proved by the fact that a cure resulted when raw milk
was substituted. A similar experience in Berlin reported
by Neumann and others was convincing, but was not
heeded in this country. In 1901 one of the largest dairies
in that city established a pasteurizing plant where all
milk was raised to a temperature of about 60° C. After
an interval of some months infantile scurvy began to be
reported from various sources throughout the city. Neumann
depicts the situation as follows: &ldquo;Whereas, Heubner,
Cassel and myself had seen only thirty-two cases of<span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
scurvy from 1896 to 1900, the number of cases suddenly
rose from the year 1901, so that the same observers&mdash;not
to mention a great many others&mdash;treated eighty-three
cases in 1901 and 1902.&rdquo; At a spirited meeting held by
the Berlin Medical Society in 1903 to discuss this subject,
Heubner was able to report 65 cases. An investigation
was made, and the pasteurization discontinued. The result
was almost immediate, the cases decreasing just as
suddenly as they had increased. These reports and others
demonstrate that unless additional antiscorbutic food is
given, a diet of pasteurized milk will lead to the development
of scurvy. As the antiscorbutic vitamine is not
entirely destroyed by pasteurization, the severity of the
disorder will be in inverse ratio to the amount of milk
which is consumed.</p>

<p>It has been our experience that milk pasteurized in
the home or institution did not lead to scurvy to the same
extent as that which was commercially pasteurized.
Babies fed on home-pasteurized milk did not develop manifest
scurvy. The difference in the two processes consists
mainly in the amount of handling during the process of
heating and the subsequent aging which the milk undergoes.
An interval of forty-eight hours usually elapses
between commercial pasteurization and the delivery of
the milk to the consumer. In New York city most of the
better-grade milk is pasteurized at the farm, so that it is
subjected to a longer period of aging than the poorer
grade, which is not pasteurized until it reaches the city.
Although our results indicated the effect of freshness
or staleness on milk which had been heated, they showed
also that other factors must be involved, for home-pasteurized
milk which is forty-eight hours old is superior
to the commercial product of the same age. This difference<span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
we believe is due to the handling which the milk
undergoes, to the mechanical processes involved in commercial
pasteurization.</p>

<p>In considering this aspect of the development of infantile
scurvy on a diet of heated milk, it is of interest to
refer to the experience of Switzerland and of France.
In 1907 Bernheim-Karrer reported nine cases of scurvy
which occurred on &ldquo;homogenized&rdquo; milk. This milk is
forced between rapidly-rotating surfaces at a temperature
of 55° to 65° C. at a pressure of 150 atmospheres. This
process had been introduced the year previous by a large
dairy which was well known for its excellent grade of milk.
Before this innovation, milk usually had been boiled for
a long while before being fed to infants. In France a
similar epidemic of scurvy followed the introduction of
the use of homogenized milk (lait fixé). Lecornu gives an
interesting account of this episode, remarking on the large
number of cases of scurvy occurring on this milk compared
with sterilized milk, which was employed so much more
extensively. These experiences furnish excellent examples
of <i>the harmful effect of industrial methods on milk</i>,
especially on its antiscorbutic vitamine. Lecornu also
emphasized the scorbutic influence of &ldquo;lait maternisé,&rdquo;
which is similar to the German Gaertner milk, and is subjected
to dilution, centrifugation, and sterilization.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> He
states that before this preparation was introduced scurvy
was practically unknown in France. Lecornu attributes
the deleterious effect of the &ldquo;lait maternisé&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;lait fixé&rdquo; to bacterial contamination, as does Bernheim-Karrer.<span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
We believe, rather, that its loss of potency
is due to the mechanical processes to which it has
been subjected.</p>

<p>Boiled and, more particularly, sterilized milk, is regarded
as a common cause of infantile scurvy and figures prominently
among the foods held accountable for this disorder.
It has been pointed out, however, that thousands of infants,
especially in Europe, receive milk of this kind, and
do not develop scurvy. Statistics such as those of Variot,
who has distributed in his out-patient department, during
a period of twelve years, 400,000 quarts of sterilized milk
(heated in half-litre bottles and hermetically sealed at the
farm) without observing a case of scurvy, must be
accorded weight in this connection.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Escherich, some
years previously, stated that he did not meet with scurvy
in Graz, although he was accustomed to feed babies on
sterilized milk. Budin, the celebrated French children&rsquo;s
specialist, writes: &ldquo;As for the so-called infantile scurvy
which is alleged to follow the use of sterilized milk, I
have heard a very great deal about it during the last few
years, but I am still looking for my first case.&rdquo; Evidence
from such sources cannot be summarily cast aside, but
must be given due consideration. It is evident that the
mere heating or sterilization of milk, although it reduces
the antiscorbutic vitamine, does not do so to a degree
sufficient to lead to the production of clinical scurvy.
Our experience accords with that of the above observers.
Some years ago we fed infants with milk which had been
boiled for five minutes, and, at another time, made use of<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>
home-made evaporated milk which had been heated for a
period of seventeen hours, until it had been reduced to
one-eighth its volume. This evaporated milk was well
borne for months, although slightly caramelized in the
course of heating, and did not lead to any signs of scurvy.
Clearly there are other factors involved in this question
besides the mere subjection to heat. We believe that every
step in the process is important&mdash;the freshness of the
milk, whether or not it is agitated and exposed to the
air, whether it is sealed carefully and used soon after sterilization,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
and, finally, whether the baby receives a sufficient
quantity. If this milk, which has certainly lost some
of its vitamine content, is given in small amount, it will not
supply an adequate amount of the antiscorbutic factor.</p>

<p>Neumann, Czerny, and others state that they have even
cured infantile scurvy by giving boiled milk obtained from
a different source. In the Berlin epidemic, Neumann laid
particular emphasis on the fact that the milk which induced
scurvy had been doubly heated, having been pasteurized
commercially and later boiled in the home before
it was fed to the baby. Plantenga has also laid stress on
the influence of <i>two-fold heating</i>, citing an interesting
experience with scurvy in his clinic. When the milk was
pasteurized one day and boiled for five minutes on the
subsequent morning, 23 cases of infantile scurvy developed
among the 200 infants attending his dispensary.
The following year when the procedure was altered so
that the milk was merely pasteurized, no case of this disorder
developed. There can be no doubt that milk which<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
has been heated twice must have lost more of its antiscorbutic
properties than milk which has been heated but once,
and that aging also must contribute to this loss. Whether
there is what may be termed a peculiar sensitization of
milk following pasteurization, has not been definitely
shown.</p>

<p>Up to the present time <i>dried milk</i> has played an
insignificant rôle in the etiology of infantile scurvy. One
of the factors which has hindered the general acceptance
of dried milk by physicians and laymen has been the fear
that its use might lead to the development of Barlow&rsquo;s
disease. It is therefore important to consider this aspect
of the subject, especially as dried milk seems destined to be
used to an increasing extent. A recent report to the Local
Government Board by Coutts states that &ldquo;Millard and
Naisch in England confirmed the testimony of Miele in
Belgium, and Gautier and Genevoix in France, that scurvy
is not to be feared&rdquo; from this foodstuff. This coincides
with our experience, namely, that <i>dried milk not only does
not lead to scurvy, but may contain sufficient antiscorbutic
vitamine to cure this disorder</i>. Recently a scorbutic
baby was fed with milk which had been dried by the so-called
Just-Hatmaker process&mdash;whereby it is subjected
on a drum for a few seconds to about 230° F.&mdash;with the
result that the hemorrhages of the gums began to be
absorbed in about three days, and all symptoms to disappear
shortly thereafter. This infant received dried
milk to the equivalent of 24 ounces of fresh milk, and
this preparation had been dried and canned somewhat
over three months before it was used. Recently two infants,
suffering from marked scurvy, were treated with
milk which had been dried six months previously. The
one received only sixteen ounces a day and the other a<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
quart; both recovered within a few days after this food
had been substituted for malt soup. Not long ago,
as reported elsewhere in a paper by Unger and myself,
after curing a baby of scurvy by means of this
milk, it was maintained in health for a subsequent
period of three months on a diet which contained
no additional source of antiscorbutic vitamine. These
results are emphasized as illustrating the peculiar
relationship of drying and of the application of heat to
the antiscorbutic vitamine, and because recently several
reports have appeared, for example, that of Barnes and
Hume in England, and of Hart, Steenbock and Smith in
this country, to the effect that dried milk is devoid of antiscorbutic
value. The difference of opinion is due to the
assumption that dried milk is a uniform product and has
identical antiscorbutic properties. For milk to retain
its antiscorbutic value, notwithstanding drying, it must
have been rich in vitamine before desiccation, it must
have been dried quickly, and packed within the shortest
possible interval in air-tight, preferably hermetically sealed,
containers. As in relation to the heating of milk,
so in regard to its drying, it is not the degree of heat to
which it is subjected which is all important, but rather
the associated conditions. The merits of each process will
have to be tested individually and perhaps even each particular
brand of milk.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>In the foregoing, the dictum has been accepted without
comment that fresh milk may be either rich or poor in
antiscorbutic vitamine. This point of view has recently<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
gained general acceptance, on the assumption that the
milk of the stall-fed cow is markedly deficient in this factor.
Recent work by Hart, Steenbock and Ellis gives evidence
that &ldquo;summer pasture milk is much richer in this
nutritive factor than dry feed milk or winter produced
milk, involving the use in the ration of corn silage or
sugar mangels.&rdquo; In some experiments (unpublished) we
have found that dried milk shows similar variations, being
a much more potent antiscorbutic when obtained from
cows fed on fresh fodder than a similar milk from the
same cows on fodder containing a minimum amount of
antiscorbutic vitamine. The supposition of a direct quantitative
ratio between the antiscorbutic intake in the food
and output in the milk needs confirmation, especially as it
does not quite coincide with the experience among human
beings in countries where adult scurvy is endemic. In such
countries&mdash;for example, Russia&mdash;nursing infants do not
develop scurvy to the extent that would be expected, and it
is possible that this exemption is due in part to a selective
secretion of antiscorbutic vitamine into the milk.</p>

<p>As is well known, a diet of <i>condensed milk</i> leads to
scurvy. This is not surprising, considering the prolonged
heating to which this milk has been subjected. It is probable
that many cases of mild scurvy developing on this
food and characterized by beading of the ribs (rosary)
and other indefinite manifestations, have been erroneously
diagnosed as rickets.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to discuss separately the various
kinds of milk which have led to scurvy in the course of
infant feeding.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
The principles laid down in the preceding<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
discussion hold good for milk of all kinds. Heat
will destroy a certain amount of vitamine, and, if the heating
is followed by aging, still more will be lost. If an
interval elapses and a second heating ensues, there will
be further loss of vitamine.  It should never be forgotten
in considering foods in their relation to the causation of
scurvy, that <i>the amount of food</i> given must not be overlooked.
For example, a pint of ordinary pasteurized milk
will lead to scurvy, whereas a quart in most cases will be
sufficient to tide the baby over until the period of mixed
feeding. No general rule can be laid down, however, as
may be judged from the fact that dried milk which has
been subjected to almost all the influences which are deleterious
to the antiscorbutic vitamine&mdash;heating, drying,
aging, all carried out in a neutral medium&mdash;nevertheless
retains its specific potency.</p>

<p>Infantile scurvy has always been far more prevalent
in England and in America than in Europe, notwithstanding
the fact that on the continent practically all milk for
babies is boiled or sterilized. This has been ascribed, and
probably rightly so, to the widespread usage of <i>proprietary
foods</i> in the English-speaking countries. Among
the cases reported by the American Pediatric Society
about 60 per cent. had been given foods of this description.
How is this relationship to be explained? These preparations
in general may be stated to consist of cereals, sugar,
with occasionally a small amount of dried milk; they are
mixed with varying proportions of water and milk and
then cooked. It is evident that two important causative
factors of scurvy are thus furnished, namely, a small and
inadequate quota of milk and the application of heat. In
most instances not more than sixteen to twenty ounces
of milk are used to make up the day&rsquo;s feeding, and frequently<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
this has been previously pasteurized. But there
is an additional factor which comes into play in this connection,
one to which we have recently drawn attention
in treating of &ldquo;The Deleterious Effect of the Alkalization
of Infants&rsquo; Food.&rdquo; It has been shown that the antiscorbutic
vitamine is peculiarly sensitive to the faintest alkaline
reaction, in which medium it rapidly undergoes
deterioration, and even total destruction if heat is applied.
Proprietary foods, with but few exceptions, are alkaline,
having been rendered so by the addition of potassium
carbonate or bicarbonate, in order to prevent acid fermentation
of the fat and to counterbalance the relative
poverty of potassium in cow&rsquo;s milk. Little or no regard
has been paid to this reaction; the textbooks on children&rsquo;s
diseases give this point no consideration whatsoever, expressing
the salt content merely in terms of total ash.
By this means ideal conditions are furnished for the
destruction of a large part of the vitamine, and if this
factor is not present in excess, scurvy will readily develop.
It is to these various circumstances&mdash;the deficiency of
milk, the alkalinity and the heating&mdash;that the scorbutic
quality of proprietary foods is to be ascribed.</p>

<p>The most flagrant example of an infant&rsquo;s food leading
to scurvy is &ldquo;malt soup&rdquo;&mdash;an alkaline preparation of
malt, which is prepared with flour and a small amount of
milk.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> This food brings about scurvy almost invariably
unless an antiscorbutic is added to the dietary. That this
effect is due to the alkaline potassium carbonate was
shown by a recent test which is illustrated in chart.
(Fig. 2). Here we see that in a case of scurvy, when the<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
food was altered and prepared with the same amount of
milk and alkali, the disorder did not abate (although the
carbohydrate had been discontinued), but when the potassium
carbonate was omitted a gain in weight ensued, and,
we may add, the symptoms disappeared.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/fig_002.png" width="425" height="110" alt="Weight curve of scorbutic baby. Effect of alkalization of milk" />
<a id="Fig_2"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Human scurvy: weight curve of a baby that developed scurvy on a diet of malt
soup (period 1). During period 2 the flour and malt soup were omitted from the diet, the
same amount of milk and potassium carbonate being continued. The disorder did not abate.
The only change in period 3 was a discontinuation of the potassium carbonate. This brought
about a gain in weight and cure, showing the destructive effect of the alkali on the vitamine.
</div>

<p>A test of this kind once more raises the question
whether carbohydrates lead to the development of scurvy.
As previously stated, there are many who believe that the
carbohydrates, especially starch, have this harmful effect
by requiring a large amount of the various vitamines for
their metabolism. This relationship was first brought
forward by Bradden and Cooper in regard to beriberi. It
is a suggestion which cannot be disregarded in view of
the great amount of scurvy which comes about on diets
rich in carbohydrates, especially those containing malt
sugar. We do not believe, however, that the harmful
effect which this foodstuff exerts can be explained on the
above hypothesis, as experience has shown that infants
may receive for many months equally large amounts of
carbohydrates&mdash;cane sugar, flour, or a combination of
both&mdash;and nevertheless not manifest a similar tendency to
develop scurvy.</p>

<p><b>Age Incidence.</b>&mdash;Scurvy may occur at any age if the<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
diet does not furnish sufficient antiscorbutic factors. As
a matter of fact, it is encountered most often among infants
and adults, not because these two age-groups are
particularly susceptible, but because there are peculiar
attendant circumstances. In the case of the infant, it is
due to the fact that for almost the entire first year of its
life it is dependent entirely upon milk, a foodstuff poor in
antiscorbutic vitamine, and containing, under favorable
conditions, barely enough to meet its requirement. If,
therefore, the potency of the milk is weakened, or if an
insufficient quantity is fed, and more particularly when
both of these factors are involved, a scorbutic condition
will ensue. The reason why older children, those over
one and a half or two years of age, do not develop scurvy
is largely due to their varied and liberal diet, which is
amply provided by the mother or guardian, so that even
in times of want they receive more than their due share
of the available food supply.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>From a clinical standpoint scurvy may be said to occur
in infants during the second half year of their lives. There
is general agreement on this point; it is borne out by the
investigation of the American Pediatric Society and by
the statistics of various individuals. On the basis of a
large experience, Still states that nearly eighty per cent.
of the cases appear between the ages of six and ten months,<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
and that in no case did the disorder occur before the age
of five months. It is of importance from both the etiologic
and the therapeutic standpoint to distinguish clearly
between the age when infantile scurvy is commonly diagnosed,
and the earlier stage when it appears as a general
nutritional disorder. We must remember that scurvy generally
takes from six to nine months to become manifest,
this developmental period varying mainly in proportion
to the degree of the dietary deficiency. It is evident,
therefore, that there must be a prolonged period of nutritional
failure which precedes the diagnosis. This stage
consists of two early phases, the first months where the
faulty diet causes no apparent change and seems to have
no deleterious effect on the infant, and the second, of
latent and subacute scurvy. The &ldquo;latent&rdquo; condition is
one merely of unsatisfactory nutrition and retarded
growth, which it is not possible to interpret; &ldquo;subacute
scurvy,&rdquo; which develops subsequently, is distinguished
by characteristic signs and symptoms. We shall not review
their symptomatology, as it is given in the chapter
devoted to this topic. The subject is brought forward in
this connection to emphasize the fact that the scorbutic
condition occurs far earlier than is generally realized,
and furthermore, that if the earlier and more subtle symptoms
of scurvy were comprehended, the age incidence
would fall earlier than the current figures indicate. The
earliest instance of this disorder which we have seen
occurred in a baby four and a half months of age.</p>

<p>Age does not seem to play a definite rôle in regard
to the incidence among adults. Scurvy frequently has
been encountered among old men, and is of common occurrence
among the most vigorous of the nation, the young
soldiers and sailors. Some have stated that it takes place<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
less often among soldiers in the twenties than among
those in the thirties, but this has not been demonstrated.
The fewest cases have been reported among children over
two years of age. It was due to the apparent immunity
of this age-group that, until very recently, German writers
doubted the identity of infantile and adult scurvy. The
exclusion of children of this age is merely fortuitous and,
moreover, is by no means absolute. One of the earliest
cases of scurvy in children, reported by Montfalcon,
occurred in a child six years old. Bateman in America
described a case in a child of about this age. Barlow,
in one of his first articles, reported scurvy in a small
group of older children. The case so frequently quoted
by German authors in this connection is that of Fraenkel,
who described both clinically and pathologically a case of
scurvy in a boy eight years of age. These cases by no
means exhaust the number which are reported. Recently,
Tobler has given us an account of scurvy, occurring during
the war, in a Viennese foundling asylum which harbored
children between the ages of two and fourteen.</p>

<p><b>Season and Climate.</b>&mdash;Many of the older writers laid
great stress on the influence of season on the occurrence
of scurvy, which they believed broke out particularly in
the cold and damp months of the fall, winter and early
spring. It is true that most of the epidemics have occurred
at these seasons of the year. This is merely what should
be expected, considering that the disease depends mainly
upon the supply of fresh fruits and vegetables. Where
conditions are abnormal, as in war, there have been notable
exceptions to this seasonal incidence. In the &ldquo;Report
of the War of the Rebellion&rdquo; there is an instructive
graph illustrating the occurrence of scurvy in our Civil
War and in the Crimean War, which shows that this<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
disease prevailed to the greatest extent during the winter
months in the former, whereas in Crimea, the season of
greatest frequency was the summer time. One of the
severest outbreaks of scurvy on record is that which
occurred at the siege of Thorn in Germany in the year
1703. During the months of July and August, when the
weather was excessively hot, scurvy ravaged the besieged
army. There are, furthermore, many reports of
scurvy in the tropics during the dry season. In the
island of Aruba, in the Dutch West Indies, which has
been visited by scurvy year after year, and which is
referred to elsewhere, the disease is endemic during the
dry, hot season. Formerly it broke out on the men-of-war
and vessels of the mercantile marine while they were
in southern waters. As regards infantile scurvy, it has
always seemed to us that season played a slight rôle; that
cases which occurred in the summer tended to be less
severe and to be characterized by periods of intermission
rarely observed in the winter time.</p>

<p>The effect of <i>climate</i> has been accorded a variable place
in the etiology of scurvy. Lind believed that a damp, cold
climate, such as that of the Low Countries, was conducive
to scurvy. On the other hand, since it is realized that diet
is the essential element, all other factors have been
regarded as of no moment whatsoever. It is difficult to
pass judgment on this question, since scurvy is now endemic
in such a limited area of the world. It seems quite
possible that a damp, cold climate, which depresses the
various functions of the body, may exert an influence
where the quota of antiscorbutic foodstuff is not quite
adequate. Exposure to infection is also greater under
such climatic conditions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span></p>
<p>Economic status has to be considered in connection with
infantile scurvy. Numerous writers have drawn attention
to the fact that scurvy is seen relatively more frequently
among the infants of the well-to-do and the rich
than among those of the poor. This curious and paradoxical
situation is due to the zealous care which the
former receive&mdash;the extreme precautions in sterilizing
the milk, the addition to the formulas of expensive proprietary
foods, the watchfulness to avoid the child&rsquo;s obtaining
a chance bit of fruit or vegetable. Since the
popularization of commercially-pasteurized milk in the
larger municipalities, and the advertising propaganda
for the sale of &ldquo;baby foods&rdquo; which has extended their use
among the masses, this distinction in the social status has
been largely obliterated.</p>

<p>Sex seems to play no part in the etiology of scurvy.
Several writers have claimed, however, that there is a
certain degree of racial immunity. For example, Sheppard
reports that the Zhob Kakai seldom develops scurvy,
although he naturally excludes vegetables from his diet,
and Boerich noted among the prisoners of war that the
Slavs, especially the White Russians, were more susceptible.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
Of course a lack of susceptibility of this
nature can be merely relative. Such a racial distinction
may seem far-fetched, but if we admit that disposition and
habits of life can play a rôle, it is quite possible for races
to vary in their predisposition to this disorder. Moreover,
we shall see that individuals differ markedly in this respect.
Lind and others repeatedly emphasize the fact that<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
the indolent and slothful sailor was stricken with scurvy
far oftener than the one who was active, and claimed
that physical exercise even tended to bring about a cure.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
Those who have had a large experience with scurvy in
adults are almost unanimous in believing that a <i>psychic
element</i> enters into its etiology. In this way, in a measure,
they account for the frequency of scurvy among defeated
troops, in besieged armies, and among men depressed by
homesickness, fatigue, and discouragement. This point of
view cannot be lightly disregarded, bearing in mind that
depressed mental states alter the functions of the organs
and markedly affect secretion. The many cases and epidemics
in institutions for the insane cannot, however, be
attributed to this cause, but are probably almost entirely
due to a want of supervision of the dietary. Among infants,
the question of the influence of race and of the
mental state needs but little consideration.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> For some
time we have carefully observed the course of scurvy
among happy and contented infants compared with those
of an unhappy and fretful disposition; in some instances
the former, although the diet was similar, seemed to develop
scurvy less readily than the latter.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that there is <i>predisposition</i> to
scurvy, as there is, probably, to every nutritional disorder.
Among soldiers and sailors a certain number
develop scurvy on the same ration which does not harm
others. Some years ago when scurvy developed among<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
a group of infants fed on pasteurized milk, this idiosyncrasy
was noted. The distinction, however, is rarely
sharply defined. Careful clinical investigation will generally
show that the infants which seem to be spared are
not thriving quite normally; they are somewhat pale,
and do not gain in weight as they should, and their appetite
is poor. The most interesting experience of this kind is
the following which is frequently cited: In a family where
the first child developed scurvy, Finkelstein took the
precaution, in the case of the second child, to have the
milk boiled for as short a time as possible, and to begin
mixed feeding early. In spite of these precautions this
boy also developed scurvy. Finkelstein states that once
before he had met with a similar mishap. An experience
which he relates, regarding a foster-mother, an excellent
nurse, who had three infants in succession develop scurvy
in spite of preventive measures, is also of interest in this
connection. The latter occurrence evidently cannot be
attributed to hereditary or family predisposition, and
serves to emphasize the inherent difficulties of the subject.
v. Starck&rsquo;s report of an instance where twins were fed
on similar milk mixtures and one developed scurvy,
whereas the other thrived satisfactorily, is a striking
illustration of the rôle of idiosyncrasy. This case, as
well as many others, fails to be absolutely convincing
in view of the fact that the daily intake of milk is
not recorded.</p>

<p>A predisposition to scurvy cannot be ascribed to a
condition of general malnutrition. For example, among
infants it has never seemed that those suffering from
marasmus or atrophy were particularly prone to develop
scurvy. Whether syphilis, tuberculosis or malaria tends<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
to precipitate the onset of this disorder cannot be stated.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
In view of the fact that prematurity is such an important
factor in the pathogenesis of rickets, it would be of interest
to know whether a similar relationship exists between
infantile scurvy and prematurity. The only clinical condition
which we have found predisposing to scurvy is the
&ldquo;exudative diathesis&rdquo; of Czerny, a term which implies a
tendency to develop exudations of the skin or of the
mucous membranes. Probably it is not without significance
that in this diathesis the blood-vessels may evince
a decided weakness, an increased permeability, as demonstrated
by the &ldquo;capillary resistance test.&rdquo; (See
<a href="#Page_176">Symptomatology</a>.)</p>

<p>Nothing whatsoever is known regarding the possible
influence of the fat, protein, carbohydrate and salt content
of the diet on the development of scurvy. Is it entirely
immaterial whether one or another food element largely
predominates, or is the antiscorbutic factor to some extent
modified by other components of the food? Influences
of this kind, which at most are secondary, cannot be
ascertained by the biologic test which at present has to
be relied on to measure the development of scurvy and the
potency of antiscorbutics. It is quite possible that the
course of scurvy may be affected by the character of
gastric and intestinal digestion, by the activity of the
glands which pour their secretions into these organs, by
the destruction or elimination of the antiscorbutic factor
in the food. The frequent association of dysentery and
scurvy noted during the recent war and referred to by
many previous writers, shows the effect of intestinal disorders.
These hypotheses are tentatively advanced because<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
it is evident that some factor exists, apart from the
mere antiscorbutic value of the diet, which at times exerts
a potent influence on the development of scurvy. Cases
developing in spite of a moderate amount of antiscorbutic
food, and others not responding to the addition of vegetables
or fruit to the diet&mdash;although not numerous&mdash;have
occurred too frequently and have been reported by too
experienced observers to be brusquely disregarded. For
example, Neumann, one of the keenest clinical students of
scurvy, stated that he had met with four instances of this
nature. Hess and Fish reported two similar experiences.</p>

<p>The secondary etiologic factors are mainly predisposing;
a few words, however, must be added concerning
what may be termed <i>exciting factors</i>. Infection is the
most important condition which may suddenly and precipitously
induce scurvy. This fact was brought to our
attention in 1912 in connection with the outbreak of scurvy
among infants receiving pasteurized milk. Its explanation
was not clear at the time, but was elucidated by subsequent
experience, and was described in 1917 as follows:
&ldquo;Latent scurvy was prematurely changed to florid scurvy
by the presence of a ward infection; an epidemic of
&lsquo;grippe&rsquo; precipitated an epidemic of scurvy exceptional
in its hemorrhagic tendency.&rdquo; The association of scurvy
and infection has been recently emphasized by McCarrison
and others, and seems to hold good for the other so-called
deficiency diseases. In this connection one other exciting
cause of scurvy may be mentioned, namely, trauma. The
older writers noticed that following a fall or an accident,
a sailor frequently developed scurvy, and Barlow in 1894
remarked on the influence of trauma in connection with
infantile scurvy. As might be inferred, its effect is mainly
to induce premature rupture of the weakened blood-vessels;<span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>
in infants we have seen this occasioned by pressure
exerted on the lower end of the thigh to ascertain the
presence of tenderness. Viewing the situation broadly,
it must be acknowledged that except for the realization
that scurvy is due to a new food factor&mdash;a vitamine&mdash;our
fundamental understanding of its pathogenesis has advanced
but little, in spite of the employment of experimental
methods and the availability of modern technic.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether mere clinical studies will contribute
in a large measure to the solution of the pathogenesis
of scurvy. Much may, however, be learned by
investigations of the metabolism in human scurvy&mdash;an
aspect of the problem which, as will be brought out in a
subsequent chapter, hardly has been explored. By this
means may be acquired a clearer understanding of the
effect of an antiscorbutic deficiency on the tissues and on
cellular activity. Much may be expected from physiologic
and pharmacologic studies of the specific vitamine, although
it is not yet available in a pure state. Finally, it is
probable that the solution of similar questions relating
to the pathogenesis of cognate disorders&mdash;a study which
is engaging the best efforts of so many workers throughout
the world&mdash;will shed light on this particular disease.</p>

THE ANTISCORBUTIC VITAMINE<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></h2>


<p>We shall not discuss the subject of vitamines in general,
but confine ourselves to the more limited field of the
antiscorbutic vitamine. The recognition of the &ldquo;accessory&rdquo;
dietary factors is of such recent date, however, that
it will be well to consider briefly how attention came to
be directed to them and how their existence was ascertained.
As in the case of so many scientific discoveries,
it is difficult to point to the exact time when the advance
was made. On looking back we find that Lunin, in 1881,
noting that mice were unable to live on a diet consisting
of protein, fats, carbohydrates, salts and water, came to
the conclusion &ldquo;that other substances indispensable to
nutrition must be present in milk besides caseinogen, fat,
lactose and salts.&rdquo; This work did not stimulate similar
investigations, nor did Lunin, as might have been expected,
allude to scurvy. The work which focussed attention
on this novel aspect of dietetics was the report of
Eijkman, in 1897, to the effect that when fowl are fed
decorticated rice, they develop a disease resembling beriberi,
and that the paralytic symptoms disappear on feeding
them rice polishings or its alcoholic extract. Here,
for the first time, was a positive rather than a negative
experiment, and one capable of simple verification. The
subject was placed on a scientific basis by the classic investigation
of Hopkins, who experimented with purified<span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
food substances, and demonstrated how diets which were
deficient could be rendered adequate. As early as 1906
he wrote &ldquo;the animal body is adjusted to live either upon
plant tissues or other animals, and these contain countless
substances other than the proteins, carbohydrates and
fats.&rdquo; &ldquo;In diseases such as rickets, and particularly in
scurvy, we have had for long years knowledge of a dietetic
factor, but though we know how to benefit these conditions
empirically, the real errors in the diet are to this day quite
obscure.&rdquo; The work of Osborne and Mendel, and McCollum
and Davis in this country, of Schaumann, Funk,
Stepp and others, all led to the conclusion that purified
diets are unable to satisfy the nutritive requirements of
rats or mice, and that extracts of the natural foods suffice
to render the diet adequate.</p>

<p>The same rule holds for man, who, when deprived of
these vitamines, develops the so-called deficiency diseases&mdash;typically
modern disorders. Regarded as a group, they
are a consequence of our altered mode of life and peculiar
civilization. They follow naturally upon the development
of immense cities housing millions of people, who necessarily
must receive perishable foodstuffs produced at a
great distance. To even a greater extent they are the
product of countless ingenious methods devised mainly to
render foods stable&mdash;drying, heating, the addition of preservatives&mdash;most
of which accomplish their object, but
incidentally rob the food of its essential vitamine.</p>

<p>None of the vitamines has been isolated in a pure state.
The nearest approach to this desired end has been the
work of Funk, who obtained the water-soluble vitamine
in a state of such concentration that about 3 mg. sufficed
to cure a pigeon of polyneuritis. In considering the
attributes of the antiscorbutic vitamine, it must be borne<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
in mind that this factor is referred to as it exists in
various foods; for example, in orange juice or in cabbage,
and furthermore, that the method of ascertaining its
presence or concentration is limited to the crude biological
test of animal feeding.</p>

<p>The antiscorbutic factor is distinguished by being the
most sensitive of the three vitamines, the most unstable,
the least resistant to physical or chemical processes. It
may be regarded as one of the most delicate indicators of
the biological integrity of foodstuffs; however, as Falk
and his co-workers have shown, the enzyme property of
living matter is still more readily destroyed. The antiscorbutic
vitamine is soluble in water, and therefore is
termed by some the &ldquo;water-soluble C&rdquo; factor. It is also
soluble in alcohol, as shown by the experiments of Hess
and Unger and of Harden and Zilva, and the therapeutic
tests on infants of Freise and of Freudenberg.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> It
possesses, therefore, the solubility of the water-soluble
vitamine. Some have suggested that it may be derived
from this vitamine, others that instead of one there may
be a series of antiscorbutic factors&mdash;suggestions based on
pure hypothesis. Holst and Froelich showed that this
vitamine passes, without appreciable loss, through dialyzing
parchment, and Harden and Zilva (2) that it can pass
through a porcelain filter. The latter, using the method
of Seidell, demonstrated that this vitamine is not adsorbed
by fine precipitates such as fuller&rsquo;s earth, differing
in this respect from the water-soluble vitamine; and
that in a mixture of equal volumes of autolyzed yeast and<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
orange juice, the antiscorbutic vitamine remained
unaffected, whereas the water-soluble A was entirely
removed.</p>

<p>One of the most distinctive characteristics of the antiscorbutic
factor is its <i>sensitiveness to even moderately
high degrees of heat</i>. In this respect it differs markedly
from the water-soluble or so-called &ldquo;antineuritic vitamine&rdquo;
which withstands exposure to high temperature.
The reaction of the antiscorbutic vitamine in this regard
is not a simple one, and cannot be expressed by a mere
statement of the degree of heat and the length of exposure.
Numerous other factors, especially the reaction
of the medium, but also the physical environment, must
be taken into consideration&mdash;for example, cabbage is more
resistant to the action of heat than its juice. An understanding
of the relation of antiscorbutics to heat may perhaps
best be obtained by considering the subject in connection
with some definite foodstuffs. The most exhaustive
study from a quantitative standpoint is that of Delf.
She showed that when cabbage is subjected for an hour
to a temperature of 80° to 100° C., 90 per cent. of its
antiscorbutic vitamine is lost, and that 80 per cent. is
lost when a temperature of 90° to 100° is maintained for
twenty minutes, or a temperature of 60° for a period of
sixty minutes. This experiment shows that the destructive
influence of heat is enhanced to a comparatively
slight degree by a rise of temperature, only about threefold
when it is raised from 60° C. to the boiling point.
This result points to a temperature coefficient of about
1.5 to 10° C. of temperature. It is suggested by Delf
that this low coefficient of destruction is opposed to the
enzyme or protein-like theory of the nature of the vitamine,
and suggests a simpler constitution. On the other<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
hand, we must bear in mind that the proteins which have
been used in experiments and found to possess a high
coefficient of heat, have been tested in the pure state,
whereas the vitamine of the cabbage is bound up in the cell.</p>

<p>Experiments with this vitamine as found in milk
accord with the above investigation, demonstrating that
intensity of heat is not as destructive as prolonged heating.
This agrees with the clinical experience that milk which
has been boiled for a few minutes does not induce scurvy
as readily as pasteurized milk which has been heated for
45 minutes to 140° or 165° F. (Hess and Fish).</p>

<p>As demonstrated by tests with orange and with lemon
juice, the antiscorbutic vitamine is greatly protected from
the destructive effect of heat when it is associated with
an acid. This was shown first by Holst and Froelich and
has been confirmed by numerous observers. An excellent
example of marked thermostability conferred on a food
by its acid reaction is furnished by the tomato, which is
strongly antiscorbutic even after it has been subjected to
the canning process. Conversely, Harden and Zilva have
shown that the vitamine is destroyed by alkali even when
dilute (one-fiftieth normal sodium hydrate) and kept in
contact at room temperature; this alteration does not take
place at once, but in the course of several hours.</p>

<p>It is true that the antiscorbutic factor is peculiarly
sensitive to <i>drying</i>, but there are exceptions to this rule,
so that it is incorrect to state, as does the British Report
of the Medical Research Committee, that &ldquo;it may be
regarded as an axiom that dry or dried foodstuffs will
not prevent scurvy.&rdquo; We have shown that fresh milk
dried by the Just-Hatmaker process may retain by far
the greater moiety of its virtue. In this regard rapidity
of desiccation and subsequent protection from oxidative<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>
processes are important factors. The general rule holds
true, however, that this vitamine, in contradistinction to
the &ldquo;water-soluble&rdquo; vitamine, is readily damaged and
destroyed by drying.</p>

<p>This vitamine is peculiarly sensitive to <i>aging</i>, especially
when it is present in an alkaline or neutral medium;
but even in an acid medium its potency soon diminishes.
Harden and Zilva found this to be the case with lemon
juice stored for a fortnight in the cold room, and our
experience has been similar in regard to orange juice kept
in the refrigerator under a layer of liquid petrolatum.
In milk the antiscorbutic factor diminishes with age, especially
following pasteurization, in the course of which
most of the acid-forming bacteria have been destroyed.
Aging has the least effect when the food with which the
vitamine is associated has been dried. This is true not
only of lemon and of orange juice as demonstrated experimentally
and clinically, but even of milk, which even after
it has been dried and stored for months, may still possess
marked curative value.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>Experiments by Harden and Zilva showed that exposure
of lemon juice to <i>ultra-violet rays</i> for eight hours
does not influence its antiscorbutic activity, that exposure
of autolyzed yeast for the same length of time likewise
does not impair its &ldquo;antineuritic&rdquo; potency, but that under
identical conditions the fat-soluble factor in butter becomes
inactivated. Similar tests carried out by the author
with orange juice led to the same result. It thus appears
that one of the vitamines&mdash;not the most unstable&mdash;manifests
a peculiar sensitiveness to a certain form of physical
or chemical action.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span></p>
<p>In view of the fact that <i>shaking</i> partly destroys pepsin
and rennin, as shown by Shaklee and Meltzer, it would be
of interest to ascertain whether this process brings about
any impairment of the antiscorbutic vitamine. Particular
interest is attached to this question because it is
generally recognized that milk loses some of its potency
in the course of handling&mdash;whatever may be comprised by
this term. In experiments on the fat-soluble vitamine
Steenbock and his co-workers found that &ldquo;somewhere in
the course of the manipulation to which the butter fat had
been subjected, factors had been introduced which were
responsible for a vitamine destruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before discussing the question of the manner in which
the antiscorbutic vitamine functionates, it may be well to
state briefly the type of the disturbance which its deficiency
occasions. The chief manifestation is damage to
the integrity of the endothelium of the vessels, resulting in
hemorrhage&mdash;whether from diapedesis or from rhexis
or both of these conditions, the microscope does not inform
us. Nor can it be stated positively that the endothelium
has not been injured by a secondary toxic or bacterial
factor. However this may be, the end result of the deficiency
is endothelial damage, a pathologic condition which
may be demonstrated clinically in scurvy by the &ldquo;capillary
resistance test&rdquo; (<a href="#Page_176">chapter VII</a>). The other marked
functional alteration in scurvy is increased susceptibility
to infection; but how a vitamine deficiency induces this
vulnerability cannot be explained. Clinical tests show
that the blood contains sufficient antitoxin (diphtheria) to
afford protection. Harden and Zilva found that &ldquo;guinea-pigs
fed on an unrestricted mixed diet, on a quantitatively
restricted mixed diet, and a scorbutic diet showed no differentiation
in amboceptor and agglutinin titres, and in<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
the complement activity of the blood.&rdquo; If this is to be
interpreted as indicating that the protective substances of
the body undergo but little alteration, we must consider
whether susceptibility to infection, as well as tendency to
hemorrhage, is not due largely to alteration in the cement
substance of the endothelial and epithelial membranes.</p>

<p><b>The Mode of Action of the Vitamine.</b>&mdash;One of the most
interesting as well as puzzling questions in regard to the
antiscorbutic vitamine concerns the manner in which it
prevents or cures scurvy. It is a subject which at present
is in a state of flux, hardly having emerged from the realm
of hypothesis, so that detailed consideration will profit
little. At first the <i>modus operandi</i> was explained and
accepted as enzyme action, but it was soon evident, in
view of the thermostability of the vitamine, that it could
not be classed as a ferment or enzyme in the generally-accepted
sense of this term. In general, it may be stated
that there are two main views: one that the vitamine acts
directly, and the other that it acts indirectly through the
function of the endocrine glands. <i>Direct action</i>, furthermore,
may be accomplished in at least one of three ways.
The vitamine may (1) serve as a source of nutriment for
the tissues, (2) exert an antitoxic effect on toxic products,
or (3) function as a catalyzer. The first interpretation is
evidently the simplest and conforms to the long-established
knowledge of caloric food factors. That such small
amounts as 2 c.c. of orange juice daily should suffice to
protect an animal from nutritional disaster runs counter,
however, to former conceptions of food nutrition. Further
than this there is little against this viewpoint. In its
favor is the fact that, up to a certain point, antiscorbutics
act in direct ratio to the amount given; for example, 2 c.c.
of canned tomato juice is insufficient to prevent scurvy in<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
guinea-pigs, 3 c.c. will protect some but not all of a series,
whereas when the amount is increased to 4 c.c. daily all
animals will be saved. As we are considering new food
factors it is manifestly unwise to judge them by old standards,
and to decide offhand that they cannot possess such
a high degree of nutritive power. This question must be
regarded as still open.</p>

<p>The antitoxic theory suffers from the fact that the
toxic origin of scurvy cannot be established. Before this
is possible, it is clear that it will be difficult to bring forward
convincing evidence of a neutralizing substance.
Against this theory is the fact that elimination therapy is
of no avail in the treatment of infantile scurvy. Hess and
Unger (1919) failed to alleviate the symptoms by means
of catharsis, diuresis, sweating and repeated intravenous
injections of normal salt solution. In its favor it may be
advanced, in a general way, that the vitamine, in many
characteristics, resembles an antitoxin&mdash;in its extreme
lability, its destruction by heat, aging and alkalies. On
the other hand, antitoxins also are readily destroyed by
acid which, as has been shown, exerts a protective influence
on the antiscorbutic factor. The rapidity of action of the
vitamines, one of the most impressive phenomena, calls
to mind the neutralizing action of an antitoxin, and probably
has given rise to the analogy. Williams suggests
that the vitamines have &ldquo;a general, non-specific, antitoxic
or eliminative action&rdquo; on toxic substances resulting from
the metabolic decomposition of food.</p>

<p>The theory has been advanced that the action of the
vitamines is catalytic. Although this viewpoint has been
taken regarding the water-soluble rather than the
antiscorbutic vitamine, it will be well to review briefly
the work on which it is based. Among the first to suggest<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>
this hypothesis were Vedder and Clark, who noted a relationship
between the amount of vitamine required by fowls
and their carbohydrate intake. Funk in 1913 made a similar
observation in regard to beriberi, and in the following
year, with von Schoenborn, showed that a vitamine-free
diet led to hyperglycæmia, with diminished amount of
hepatic glycogen, and that the addition of water-soluble
vitamine diminished the hyperglycæmia and increased the
liver glycogen. The work of Burge and his co-workers on
the catalase content of tissue led to a similar conclusion.
Their results may be summarized by the statement that
the oxidative processes are hampered and fail to balance
the autolytic changes, and, furthermore, that a relationship
exists between the catalase activity, acidosis and
normal oxidative processes. This theory would presuppose
that scurvy is due to the formation of toxins
which are normally in process of continual destruction
in the body. According to some, these catalyzed
toxic substances are metabolic in character, originating
from incompletely oxidized food; according to another
interpretation, they are the product of autolyzed tissue
cells (tissue toxins). The difficulty with this explanation
is that scurvy cannot be prevented or cured by a diet containing
food of high catalytic power. For example, wheat
embryos which, according to recent investigations of
Crocker and Harrington, have a high catalytic activity,
were found of no therapeutic value in relation to infantile
scurvy (Hess, 3).</p>

<p>This problem has been approached from quite a different
angle. As is well known, certain bacteria require
serum, blood, milk, etc., in order to grow satisfactorily
on artificial culture media. It has been established
recently, primarily by the work of Lloyd, that<span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
this peculiarity in the cultivation of microörganisms is
due largely to their requirement of vitamine. She found
a relationship of the inverse order between the amount of
amino acid present in the culture medium and the amount
of vitamine required to stimulate the growth of strains of
meningococcus. Reasoning from this experience, she suggests
that the action of the accessory growth factors is to
increase the reaction velocity of the proteolytic metabolism.
Here we find the vitamines once more regarded as
catalyzers. This author, however, associates their activity
with proteolytic rather than with carbohydrate metabolism.
Interesting and suggestive work of similar nature
has been carried out in relation to the growth of protozoa
and of yeasts (Eddy). Investigations of this kind, dealing
with unicellular organisms propagated on a simple food,
have the advantage of greatly simplifying the problem.</p>

<p>The recent work of Dutcher falls under this caption,
differing merely in the fact that he attributes to the vitamines
an <i>indirect action</i>. He has demonstrated that the
tissues of polyneuritic birds show a decrease in catalase
activity to a point 56 per cent. below normal, and that
this activity is largely restored when the birds are cured
with vitamine. According to this writer the vitamine
functions as a metabolic stimulant, and its lack results
in a depression of the body oxidations with an accompanying
formation of toxic metabolic products, injurious to the
nervous system. The action is regarded as coming about
in an indirect manner, being accomplished through the
hormone action of the vitamines on one or more glands of
internal secretion.</p>

<p>The <i>endocrine hypothesis</i>, suggested by Funk in his
monograph, is not without some corroborative evidence.
In testing the pharmacologic action of the water-soluble<span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
vitamine, Uhlmann found that it stimulated the various
glands of the digestive tract, in this respect acting like
pilocarpine. Some years ago Albert expressed the opinion
that the action of this vitamine was &ldquo;vagotropic&rdquo; like
atropine, and recently Dutcher has reported definite relief
and cessation of polyneuritic symptoms by means of pilocarpine
(0.5 mg. subcutaneously). He claims equally
good results from thyroxin, the hormone of the thyroid
gland, from desiccated thyroid and from tethelin (pituitary).
Voegtlin and Myers conclude, as the result of
experiments with brewers&rsquo; yeast, that the chemical and
physical properties of secretin and vitamine are identical.</p>

<p>The early work of Funk and Douglas, which showed
that various <i>glands of internal secretion</i> diminish in size
and undergo degenerative changes when the diet is vitamine-free,
the newer work of McCarrison and of Dutcher
to the same effect, clearly point to an intimate relationship
between some of the endocrine glands and the vitamines.
As regards scurvy, the only work is that of Rondoni,
McCarrison and of LaMer and Campbell on the adrenal
glands, which were found by all to be enlarged in guinea-pigs
suffering from this disorder. These investigations
must be regarded as tentative rather than conclusive until
confirmed by similar necropsy reports in man. In this
connection it should be noted that thyroid, parathyroid or
suprarenal extract is of no avail in the treatment of scurvy.
This failure may, however, be explained by the fact that
the normal balance of glandular activity was not established.
We must bear in mind, however, that although the
vitamines may influence the secretion of the glands of internal
secretion, this explanation does not satisfactorily
account for the symptoms of the &ldquo;deficiency diseases.&rdquo;
These disorders do not in the slightest respect resemble<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
the clinical pictures which we are accustomed to associate
with a lack of activity of the glands of internal secretion.
If the polyneuritis of beriberi and the hemorrhages of
scurvy are attributable to a diminished secretion of the
endocrine glands, then it will be necessary to revise present
conceptions of their physiologic functions.</p>

<p><b>The Fate of the Vitamine in the Body.</b>&mdash;One of the most
important questions in relation to the antiscorbutic vitamine,
quite apart from its chemical nature, physiologic
function, and its source, is its fate in the human body
after it has reached the alimentary canal or been carried
to the tissues. It can be readily appreciated that our
knowledge of this aspect is very meagre. We shall endeavor,
however, to detail what little is known of this
subject, conscious of the fact that investigations of the
next few years may contradict our present viewpoints.</p>

<p>Most of the constituents necessary for the construction
of tissue or for carrying on its functions can be synthesized
by the animal body from the basal foodstuffs. It
has been ascertained within the past decade that certain
constituents&mdash;for example, some amino-acids of the protein
molecule&mdash;are building-stones which cannot be primarily
elaborated by the cells, but must be supplied by the
food. At present the vitamines&mdash;including the antiscorbutic
vitamine&mdash;are included in this new and essential group
of substances which the human organism cannot manufacture.
Animal experiments seem to bear out this conception
of the vitamine whether we regard them as dynamic
or as indispensable tissue elements in the structural sense.</p>

<p>A closely-related but less fundamental question is that
of <i>the ability of man to store vitamines</i>&mdash;whether the tissues
can hoard an excess of these factors, or whether, in
this respect, we are carrying on a precarious hand-to-mouth<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
existence in regard to cellular nutrition. It is of
course clear that at all times the various organs and
tissues must contain a certain amount of the vitamines.
This has been shown for the water-soluble or &ldquo;antineuritic
vitamine&rdquo; by the fact that even the organs of birds
which have died of polyneuritis contain an appreciable
quantity of the specific vitamine, although an insufficiency
of this very factor has led to their death. That such
is the case is demonstrated for the antiscorbutic vitamine
by the fact that muscle tissue contains sufficient antiscorbutic
to protect individuals subsisting largely on a
diet of which raw meat constitutes the sole antiscorbutic
agent (Stefánsson). It is very probable that some organs
contain more of the vitamines than others; this has been
proved for the &ldquo;antineuritic&rdquo; factor, and seems to hold
good for the antiscorbutic&mdash;the liver being particularly
rich. No quantitative study has been carried out from
this point of view regarding the antiscorbutic vitamine,
and it would be well worth our while to ascertain the relative
antiscorbutic potency of the various organs of the
body. Some time ago we undertook experiments to determine
whether the guinea-pig is capable of storing this
vitamine. One series of guinea-pigs was fed daily 6 c.c.
of orange juice for a period of two weeks, whereas another
series, of about the same weight, was given, in addition to
the basal ration, only 3 c.c. per capita (the minimal protective
dose). After this preliminary period both series
were placed on a diet containing practically no antiscorbutic.
Both groups came down with scurvy after about
the same interval, leading to the conclusion that there
could have been little if any storing of the excess vitamine
by those which received twice the &ldquo;minimal protective
dose.&rdquo; The experiments of Harden and Zilva, who fed a<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
concentrated lemon juice, showed that this potent agent
also was unable to provide against a subsequent period of
antiscorbutic deficiency. It should be realized that the
results of these tests on guinea-pigs cannot be applied to
man without tests on other species.</p>

<p>It might be thought that <i>the blood</i>&mdash;the purveyor of
the vitamines to the tissues&mdash;would be particularly rich
in these essential factors. Such, however, was not our
experience in respect to the antiscorbutic vitamine. The
blood possibly varies greatly in this respect according to
the diet of the individual, or even according to the interval
elapsing after the ingestion of antiscorbutic food.
Our opinion is based on the surprisingly poor therapeutic
effect of blood transfusion in the treatment of scurvy.
To illustrate: An infant weighing about fifteen pounds
received six intravenous injections of citrated blood&mdash;one
of 200 c.c., given by the direct method, and a month
later five smaller transfusions with citrated blood, which
aggregated 205 c.c.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> In spite of this addition of blood,
the hemorrhage and congestion of the gums did not disappear,
nor the general condition improve, as would have
happened had 50 or 75 c.c. of orange juice been given by
mouth. It seems probable that small quantities of vitamine
are being transmitted at all times by the blood and
supplied to the cells, but that its normal content of this
factor is not great. The antiscorbutic potency of blood
may perhaps be compared to that of milk. Animal investigation
may show that various vessels&mdash;for example,
those supplying or draining certain glandular organs&mdash;differ
in the antiscorbutic quality of the blood which they<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
carry. It is evident, therefore, that many transitory
factors may influence the vitamine content of the blood,
and that&mdash;as in the case of milk and fruits and vegetables&mdash;we
are not dealing with a constant and unvarying
agent.</p>

<p>Nothing whatsoever is known concerning the <i>excretion</i>
of the antiscorbutic vitamine. No attempts have been
made to recover it from the urine, or to ascertain if, when
large amounts are ingested, the excess is thrown off by the
body. This suggests the question&mdash;a corollary of that
raised in connection with the vitamine content of the
blood&mdash;whether it is immaterial if the vitamine is taken
frequently in small amounts, or is provided only occasionally
and at longer intervals in larger amounts. Is it
of no moment whether the infant receive its quota of
antiscorbutic every few hours through the medium of the
breast milk, or only once a day in the form of orange
juice or tomato? If we turn to studies on the other vitamines
for enlightenment as to the possibility of excretion,
we find that Muckenfuss recovered the water-soluble factor
from ox bile and from human urine.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> In this article
he proposes the interesting question of a possible variation
in the vitamine output under pathological conditions,
which may be responsible for the development of functional
disturbances in children.</p>

<p>It would be of interest to know the <i>fate of the antiscorbutic
vitamine in the gastro-intestinal tract</i>. How is it
affected by a lack of the acid gastric juice, or
by the alkaline intestinal secretions, or by the bacteria
in the lumen of the gut? From which part of the<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
intestine is it largely absorbed? May an appreciable
amount undergo destruction before this is accomplished?
None of these questions can be answered satisfactorily in
the present state of our knowledge, but they suggest that
the mere fact that an adequate quota of antiscorbutic vitamine
is provided in the food does not necessarily insure an
adequate supply for the tissues. If in addition to the
question of intake we must take into account that the vitamines
may suffer various vicissitudes, it may come to pass
that pathological conditions at times destroy or render
them partially inactive. In this way we may account for
irregularities in the clinical course of disorders associated
with vitamine deficiency.</p>

<p>Of prime importance, however, is the effect of the
vitamines <i>on the glands of the alimentary tract and on
the digestive processes</i>. A diminution of gastric juice, or
in some instances a total absence, has been observed in
adult scurvy, and noted by us in two cases of infantile
scurvy. As mentioned elsewhere, some consider the function
of the water-soluble vitamine analogous to that of
secretin. In applying this hypothesis to scurvy it must
be borne in mind that the sequence may be reversed, that
the lack of vitamine may not lead to the gastric achylia,
but that the achylia may come about secondarily as the
result of the malnutrition.</p>

<p>We have referred to <i>&ldquo;irregularities&rdquo; in the course of
the &ldquo;deficiency diseases.&rdquo;</i> A careful perusal of the
literature leaves one with the impression that the most experienced
observers are not entirely satisfied with the
exclusively etiologic relationship of the vitamine to its
respective nutritional disorder. In regard to scurvy, more
particularly, there are numerous scattered reports where
the disorder did not yield to antiscorbutic foods as might<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
have been expected, or where, on the other hand, it suddenly
and inexplicably retrogressed, although there had
been no alteration in the dietary.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> These instances are not
common, but they occur from time to time, and their
occurrence must be accounted for. In relation to beriberi
and avian polyneuritis improvement of this kind has frequently
been explained on the theory of a sudden mobilization
of vitamines from the tissues. There is, however,
no data on which to base such explanations, and it may
be that a lack of parallelism between vitamine intake and
the clinical course may be due at times to processes taking
place in the alimentary tract.</p>

<p>The fat-soluble vitamine has been termed by some the
growth vitamine. All the vitamines, however, are closely
associated with the function of growth, which their deficiency
tends to inhibit. In the chapter on symptomatology,
it will be pointed out that infants suffering from
scurvy fail to grow normally both in length and in weight.
To a certain extent this may be due to a loss of appetite,
which is one of the characteristic phenomena accompanying
the scorbutic condition. On the other hand, this
anorexia may be secondary and not primary to the impairment
of the growth impulse, which may lead to a dysfunction
of various body processes.</p>

<p>It is of little value to look ahead and try to foresee
what the next decade will bring forth in regard to the
nature of the vitamines. Investigation has broadened
remarkably during the past few years and now embraces
the chemical field&mdash;chemical and adsorption methods, the<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
large realm of biology, including studies in physiology
and pharmacology; and recently pathology has once more
been called upon to aid in the solution of the problem.
Probably additional vitamines will be discovered. From
time to time it has been suggested that a specific growth
vitamine exists quite distinct from the three which are
recognized, and recently Mellanby has suggested still another
food factor&mdash;a specific &ldquo;rachitic vitamine.&rdquo; When
we reflect that the characteristic functions of the various
organs&mdash;the kidneys, liver, etc.&mdash;must depend on essential
differences in chemical structure, the complexity of the
entire problem of unidentified factors becomes evident.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

PATHOLOGY</h2>


<p>Physicians have had a general knowledge of the
pathology of scurvy for a great many years. Lind, in
his &ldquo;Treatise on the Scurvy,&rdquo; published in 1772, included
a chapter on &ldquo;dissections&rdquo; and a postscript on &ldquo;Appearances
on Dissections of Scorbutic Bodies,&rdquo; based on
a large, although indefinite, number of postmortem examinations.
In the century which followed, there are to be
found many reports of scurvy, especially in connection
with the frequent wars, but it is surprising how little
detailed pathologic information they furnish. Barlow&rsquo;s
publication in 1883, establishing the identity of the scurvy
of adults and of infants, must be regarded as the modern
milestone in the study of the pathology of this disorder.
This work did not contribute richly to the data of the
subject, or suggest novel interpretations, but directed
attention to a new source of material&mdash;the increasing number
of cases of infantile scurvy&mdash;at a critical moment
when the opportunity for the study of scurvy in the adult
was rapidly becoming less. At the time of Barlow&rsquo;s exposition
of the true nature of &ldquo;acute rickets,&rdquo; scientific
medicine was concentrating its interest on pathology.
Tissues were being carefully studied by means of the
microscope, and scurvy was subjected to this new method
of investigation. As a result of intensive application of
this technic, a lesion of the bones was identified and established
as characteristic of scurvy. Study was focussed so
exclusively on the bones, that for many years, indeed until
very recently, the other organs of the body were neglected.<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
This is true of the gross as well as of the microscopic
anatomy. Protocol after protocol gives a hasty account
of the appearance of the various organs, merely as a
routine introduction to a careful and often minute study
of the bones (Table 2). As the result of this myopic vision,<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
enlargement of the heart, for example, which should have
been noted many years ago, was, until recently, unobserved&mdash;indeed,
the heart is but occasionally mentioned
in the protocols.</p>

<p>A new era in the pathology of scurvy was inaugurated
by the availability of experimental scurvy and also by
the stimulation occasioned by the recent conception of
vitamines and the so-called deficiency diseases. In endeavoring
to elucidate this fascinating problem, it has
gradually been realized that pathology may be of service&mdash;for
example, in relation to the involvement of the endocrine
glands. Accordingly, studies of the minute pathology
of the various organs have been undertaken in many
laboratories throughout the world (Italy, India, England,
Germany and the United States). An additional stimulus
to investigation in pathology has been furnished by the
recent war, which, as shown elsewhere, led to a great
increase in scurvy among both the military and civilian
population. The excellent report of Aschoff and Koch
from Roumania was made possible by this catastrophe,
and will no doubt soon be followed by others of similar
character.</p>

<p><b>Gross Pathology.&mdash;General Appearance.</b>&mdash;The skin usually
is pale, livid, and dotted with numerous petechiæ. These
vary in size from the tiniest pin-points, barely recognizable
to the naked eye, to ecchymoses of moderately
large size. The most frequent site is the lower extremities.
The trunk is always less affected, hemorrhages
tending to occur along the mid-line and especially around
the umbilicus. There may be also larger superficial
hemorrhages, showing great differences in color, from the
redder tone of the more recent, to the blues, browns
and greens of the older lesions. Bleeding from the nose<span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
and mouth is not uncommon in fatal scurvy, and occasionally
exophthalmos is present, usually unilateral, and due
to subperiosteal hemorrhage of the orbital plate of the
frontal bone. Rigor mortis is generally slight, and,
according to Lind and to von Opitz, decomposition takes
place rapidly.</p>

<p>There may be great emaciation, especially where secondary
infection has supervened. General wasting occurs,
however, in uncomplicated scurvy due to starvation&mdash;the
result of lack of appetite or a deficiency of the general
food supply. Children, especially infants, are undersized,
as illustrated in treating of the symptomatology, and their
bones may be decidedly smaller than normal. Generally
there is some <ins title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: originally &oelig;dema">edema</ins> about the ankles, and in children a
somewhat characteristic puffiness about the eyes. General
anasarca also occurs, in some cases associated with renal
involvement. Peculiar boggy, &ldquo;tumor-like&rdquo; masses of
localized edema may be present, which were considered
by the earlier writers (Lind) to be one of the typical
lesions of this condition.</p>

<p><b>Hemorrhages.</b>&mdash;Hemorrhage is such a striking manifestation
that it is not surprising to find it was regarded
by the older writers as the pathognomonic sign of scurvy.
The bleeding may take place into almost any organ, and
vary from small petechiæ to very extensive extravasations.
The hair follicles and sweat glands are particularly susceptible,
as Lasèque and Legroux noticed in cases occurring
in the French prisons. Aschoff and Koch, during the
recent war, noted the same peculiarity of involvement, calling
attention also to the fact that previous skin diseases
such as keratosis or seborrhea seemed to predispose to
this localization.</p>

<p>Trauma plays a very important rôle in determining<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
the location of the deeper as well as of the superficial
hemorrhages. In adults, especially in soldiers, in whom
the greater number of cases have been recorded, the lower
extremity is the commonest site, between the knee and
ankle, the area most exposed to blows as well as acted
upon by static congestion. In infants, the inner aspect of
the thighs is a frequent site due to the trauma of
the diaper.</p>

<p>The most characteristic hemorrhage, the subperiosteal,
will be fully discussed when considering the bone lesions.
The deeper hemorrhages may be very extensive. They
tend to follow the connective-tissue strata, and in the
muscles are usually limited by the muscle sheaths. The
blood surrounds the muscle fibres, which appear quite
intact. The neighboring blood-vessels are congested and
may contain thrombi, both venous and arterial. Such
thrombi are found also in areas where extravasation has
not taken place, and conversely, hemorrhages occur where
no thrombi are demonstrable, so that a mutual causal
relationship cannot be proved. Further evidence in regard
to the mechanism of these extravasations is presented
in the discussion of the minute anatomy. Brownish
pigment, undoubtedly derived from the blood, is frequently
found in the neighborhood of the hemorrhagic
areas. New connective tissue also grows in these areas,
so that in healing cases a marked formation of scar tissue
will be found. Bizarre forms of hemorrhage at times
have given rise to confusion in diagnosis; hemorrhage involving
the right lower abdominal quadrant may simulate
appendicitis; when occurring in the region of the
transverse colon it has been mistaken for an epigastric
new-growth.</p>

<p>Certain parts of the body seem less predisposed to<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
hemorrhage. The central nervous system is often spared,
notwithstanding extensive bleeding elsewhere, the
meninges being somewhat more frequently involved.
Hemorrhage of the lungs is also less common than might
be expected, and it is probably true as Lasèque and Legroux
suggested, that previous pulmonary disease, particularly
tuberculosis, is an important predisposing
factor.</p>

<p><b>Anasarca.</b>&mdash;This comprises the second characteristic
lesion found in scurvy at necropsy and was referred to
in the earliest records of the disease. In the account
of his dissections Lind writes: &ldquo;The breast, belly and
several other parts of the body were filled with this water
or serum,&rdquo; mentioning also the pericardium and ventricles
of the brain. He also noted that all the tissues seemed to
contain an excessive amount of fluid, a condition which
may be so striking that the muscles appear bathed in
serum. In one of his first cases with postmortem verification,
Barlow described this appearance as follows: &ldquo;The
muscular walls of the thorax were pale yellow and watery,
as though they had been bathed in serum.&rdquo; In many cases
this edema is most marked in the neighborhood of the
hemorrhages, for example, in the muscles of the thigh
when subperiosteal hemorrhage has taken place; less
frequently it is produced by venous thrombosis.</p>

<p>Any or all of the serous cavities may be involved in
this hydrops, the order of frequency being pericardium,
pleuræ, peritoneum, and joint surfaces, especially the
knee. The fluid is clear and straw-colored, or, in the event
of secondary infection, becomes cloudy and fibrino-purulent.
Later the exudate may become organized so that the
entire cavity is filled with a solid mass, which binds the
organs together and obliterates the cavity. The exudate<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
may be blood-stained or apparently consist entirely of
clotted blood.</p>

<p><b>Heart.</b>&mdash;In the protocols of most necropsies, the heart
is passed over with scant mention. For example, Lind&rsquo;s
only statement in this regard is that &ldquo;all those who died
suddenly, without any visible cause of their death, had the
auricles of their heart as big as one&rsquo;s fist, and full of
coagulated blood.&rdquo; Barlow accords it no attention, nor
do most of the writers who immediately followed him.
The first careful description of the heart is to be found
in the excellent work of Schoedel and Nauwerk, which
contains the following record in regard to three of the
five necropsies on infantile scurvy: (1) Pericardial fluid
somewhat increased, both ventricles moderately dilated,
the right somewhat hypertrophic. (2) The heart showed
a hypertrophy of the right and left ventricles, as well as
dilatation of the right ventricle. (3) The right ventricle
is dilated and slightly hypertrophied, the muscles pale
and tough. There is no word of comment relative to these
cardiac changes, which evidently were considered fortuitous.
The same observation holds true in regard to a
necropsy on an eight-year-old child reported by Ingier,
which showed a moderate hypertrophy of the left ventricle.
We look in vain, likewise, for information on the
subject in the work on guinea-pig scurvy by Holst and
Froelich, and that on scurvy in the monkey by Hart and
Lessing. The first linking of cardiac enlargement with
scurvy is found in a paper by Darling, who described
&ldquo;right-sided hypertrophy and degenerative changes in the
vagus and all its branches.&rdquo; Hess described and demonstrated
by means of roentgenograms the enlarged heart in
infantile scurvy. Recently Erdheim, in an article entitled
&ldquo;Das Barlowherz,&rdquo; reported the occurrence of<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>
enlargement of the heart, especially of the right ventricle,
in 21 out of 31 necropsies of infantile scurvy, and concluded
that a direct ratio exists between the degree of
enlargement and the intensity of the disorder. These
reports gain added interest in view of the enlargement of
the right heart so frequently encountered in beriberi, and
described by Andrews in infants dying of this condition.
In addition to the definite statement of Darling regarding
adults, mention may be made of the observation of
Aschoff and Koch, that in two cases of uncomplicated
scurvy there were fatty degeneration and dilatation of
the heart. Fatty degeneration of the muscle is frequent,
brown atrophy exceptional. Sato and Nambu also found
hyperæmia and atrophy with increase of connective tissue
between the muscle fibres.</p>

<p>The pericardial cavity contains almost invariably an
increased quantity of fluid, which may be so great as to
impede the heart&rsquo;s action. Adhesive pericarditis has been
described. The cardiac valves are normal, unless previously
damaged.</p>

<p><b>Lungs.</b>&mdash;The lungs are almost always congested, but
apart from this are remarkably free from abnormality.
Smaller or larger hemorrhages are described occasionally,
which are usually considered truly scorbutic; Andrews,
however, found similar lesions in beriberi. In the necropsy
of Stephen Mackenzie&rsquo;s case, described by Barlow,
these small hemorrhages are stated to have resembled
small red tubercles scattered throughout the lung. There
may be pulmonary infarcts. Edema of the lungs is not
uncommon, as we should expect, especially as a terminal
condition. Pneumonia, lobular or lobar, is one of the most
frequent complications and causes of death. Active tuberculosis
is a not uncommon secondary manifestation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span></p>
<p>Subserous hemorrhages are almost the rule; if infection
supervenes, the pleuræ become thickened and covered
with an exudate of pus and fibrin.</p>

<p><b>Alimentary Tract.</b>&mdash;The lesions of the gums so well
recognized clinically are fully discussed under symptomatology.
The remarkable fact that these hemorrhages do
not appear in edentulous gums has been the centre of
the controversy as to the identity of adult scurvy and
Barlow&rsquo;s disease. This same lack of involvement is noted
in adults whose teeth have been extracted. Where teeth
are present, the gums are swollen and edematous, often
of a livid, reddish color; less frequently, pale and pouting.
Hemorrhage is seen at the edge of the gum adjacent to the
teeth. In advanced cases the gums are enormously swollen,
fungous, ulcerated and covered with a foul, greenish,
necrotic mass, which may extend widely over the buccal
mucous membrane. The teeth become loosened and fall
out. Secondary infection undoubtedly plays the chief rôle
in producing this condition, for the most severe forms are
found only where caries and pyorrh&oelig;a preëxisted. This
seat of infection may serve as the source of dissemination
throughout the body, giving rise to many of the lesions
found at postmortem, especially in the lower part of
the intestinal tract.</p>

<p>The <i>stomach</i> shows no characteristic changes. Congestion
of the mucosa is frequent, at times associated with
small superficial erosions; the latter gain added interest
in view of their occurrence in guinea-pig scurvy. Hemorrhages
occur here also and may involve any of the
mural coats.</p>

<p>The <i>duodenum</i> shows often intense congestion. This
occurs with sufficient frequency to demand attention, especially
as a similar condition has been described in other<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
disorders grouped with scurvy. Willcox and others found
congestion of the duodenum and of the lower intestine in
beriberi, and Andrews described not only congestion but
even minute hemorrhages. Small duodenal ulcers are by
no means infrequent both in human and in guinea-pig
scurvy (Holst and Froelich). The presence of such
marked congestion surrounding the papilla of Vater would
lead us to expect the occurrence of catarrhal jaundice
associated with scurvy. But, on the contrary, icterus
has rarely been noted in scurvy. Urizio has described
jaundice in this connection, but it is difficult to decide
whether his cases were true scurvy, as they occurred in
an epidemic of jaundice and no histologic examination
of the bones was carried out.</p>

<p>The <i>intestine</i> may present a variety of lesions.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> The
mucosa is frequently congested and swollen, and the solitary
follicles and Peyer&rsquo;s patches enlarged. These changes
may progress to necrosis and extensive ulceration. In an
outbreak of scurvy occurring in this country in 1917, in a
large institution for epileptics, ulceration was a frequent
lesion at necropsy.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Dysentery, a frequent complication
of scurvy in some epidemics, may add to this ulceration
and lead to even complete sloughing of the inner lining of
the intestine. Hemorrhages are found in the mucous,
serous or muscular layers. Here, as elsewhere, the
hemorrhages vary in size from petechiæ to large infiltrations
of blood. A very striking picture is sometimes presented<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
by the pale, edematous intestinal wall dotted or
streaked with vivid red.</p>

<p><b>Liver.</b>&mdash;The liver is frequently congested, as would be
expected in view of the involvement of the right heart.
Erdheim found congestion, however, in only nine among
thirty-one necropsies, although enlargement of the heart
was present twenty-one times. There may be hemorrhages
in the glandular tissue or under the peritoneum.
&ldquo;Cloudy&rdquo; and fatty degenerations occur occasionally, and
in some cases an early cirrhosis. Lind found abscess of
the liver, and wrote that in a few instances &ldquo;the matter or
corruption was hardened, as it were, into a stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Spleen.</b>&mdash;This organ is usually somewhat enlarged and
congested. Charpentier, in the Paris epidemic of 1871,
found it often three to four times the normal size and very
soft, and Lind tells us that &ldquo;the spleen was three times
bigger than natural, and fell to pieces, as if composed
of congealed blood.&rdquo; It must be remembered that the
pathologic as well as the clinical picture of the scurvy
of Lind and his time was generally complicated by infection.
The enlargement is usually by no means so great,
and no doubt is due in part to intercurrent infections. On
section, it is found frequently to contain much reddish-brown
pigment. Hemorrhage may also occur. In beriberi,
Andrews observed frequent congestion of the spleen
and also a loss of normal markings.</p>

<p><b>Pancreas.</b>&mdash;There is but one reference to a lesion of the
pancreas in scurvy, that of Sato and Nambu, who encountered
hemorrhage of this organ in one case among the
necropsies performed in the course of the Russo-Japanese
War.</p>

<p><b>Kidneys.</b>&mdash;Here again, congestion and hemorrhage are<span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>
the two lesions most commonly found. The kidneys also
may show any of the forms of nephropathy ordinarily
recognized, but these must be regarded as complicating
conditions and not a part of the true scurvy.</p>

<p>Small hemorrhages may be found in the uterus, bladder
or urethra. They are especially common in the bladder,
both in man and in the guinea-pig, and in some
instances may be the cause of the hæmaturia noted during
life.</p>

<p><b>Lymph-nodes.</b>&mdash;General enlargement of the lymph-nodes
has been described, but occurs probably only in
advanced cases where a general infection has been superadded.
As a rule the enlargement is confined to nodes
draining areas where hemorrhage has occurred. On section
these nodes are reddish or brownish as the result
of the pigment which they contain, the &ldquo;black and red
spots of different sizes&rdquo; mentioned by Lind. Following
infection they may become purulent, resulting in the inguinal
buboes so frequently mentioned by the older
authors,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> or in the purulent mesenteric nodes associated
with intestinal ulceration.</p>

<p><b>Organs of Internal Secretion.</b>&mdash;Until recently these
organs have received but little attention. It is probable,
however, that in the near future they will be the object
of close study and that new information will be acquired
as to their condition in this disorder. Hemorrhages are
commonly seen in the adrenals, enlarging them greatly and
giving them a deep red color; the hemorrhage generally<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
involves mainly the medullary portion.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> It is probable
that careful scrutiny will disclose hemorrhages in the other
glands of internal secretion. The question of the involvement
of these glands will be again considered under the
microscopic anatomy, and has been taken up from a functional
standpoint in treating of the possible indirect
action of the vitamines.</p>

<p><b>The brain and the spinal cord</b> likewise have been but
little studied. It is hardly to be expected that much will
be learned from an investigation of the gross pathology
of these organs, but the microscopic anatomy offers a
promising field of research. Hemorrhage may occur into
the brain substance, into the cord or the membranes surrounding
them. Pachymeningitis hemorrhagica interna
has been described frequently (Meyer, Hayem, Sutherland,
Sato and Nambu) and may give rise to the symptoms
of meningitis. Sutherland reports an instance where
thrombosis of the basal artery was found postmortem.
In one case, that of Feigenbaum, hemorrhage of the cord
was diagnosed during life and confirmed at necropsy.</p>

<p>The peripheral nerves may be the seat of hemorrhages,
the blood lying between the nerve trunk and its sheath.
This is particularly well illustrated in the recent work of
Aschoff and Koch.</p>

<p><b>Bones.</b>&mdash;Palpation of the body will often reveal distinct
lesion of the bones, such as fractures, either ununited or
healed with the formation of large calluses; subperiosteal
hemorrhages, especially of the distal end of the femur
or of the tibia, may be evident to the eye as well as to
the touch. Crepitation of the bones may serve to further
establish the break in continuity of the bones. This lesion<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
was well known to the older writers. Lind writes that
&ldquo;in some, when moved, we heard a small grating of the
bones. Upon operating those bodies the epiphyses were
found entirely separated from the bones; which, by rubbing
against each other, occasioned this noise.&rdquo; &ldquo;All the
young persons under 18 had in some degree their epiphyses
separated from the body of the bone, this water
having penetrated into the very substance of it.&rdquo; Poupart
was also struck by this phenomenon in young adults.</p>

<p>Another bony alteration which is readily palpable is
&ldquo;beading&rdquo; of the ribs, the counterpart of the rhachitic
rosary. This has not been considered a sign of scurvy,
and when noted clinically or at postmortem has been
passed over without comment, just as has been the case
with cardiac hypertrophy. In infants the beading has
been attributed to rickets, and this error has been largely
responsible for the general opinion that almost all infants
suffering from scurvy suffer also from rickets. If we
scan the literature with this question in mind, we find
numerous casual references to beading of the ribs in
scurvy. Fraenkel&rsquo;s frequently cited case of a child of
seven who died of acute scurvy, showed beading of the
ribs during life as well as after death. The true scorbutic
character of these enlargements was substantiated by
microscopic examination. In their pathologic studies on
scurvy among soldiers, Aschoff and Koch frequently describe
beading of the ribs, which they attribute to an
infraction of the costochondral junctions.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> There may be<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>
fracture at this junction, or a separation of the cartilages
from the sternum, as described by Lind.</p>

<p>This beading of the ribs, which involves mainly the
middle tier, was described by Holst and Froelich in their
classic report of guinea-pig scurvy, and has been noted by
all subsequent investigators in this field. It has usually
been called &ldquo;rhachitic&rdquo; or &ldquo;pseudo-rhachitic&rdquo; in spite of
the fact that this junction is the site of typical scorbutic
microscopic lesions. Hart and Lessing refer to the &ldquo;rhachitic
rosary&rdquo; in monkeys, likewise not realizing that
it is the product of scurvy.</p>

<p>The subperiosteal hemorrhage has long been recognized
as a lesion characteristic of scurvy.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> It occurs exceptionally
in the upper extremities, and most commonly
at the lower end of the femur; it may, however, involve
almost any of the bones, and has been described in connection
with the scapula, cranial vault, orbital plate of the
frontal bone, ribs, etc. It varies greatly in its size, being
confined to a small area or extending a long distance on
the shaft of the bone. It rarely is as large as one would
expect from external appearance, as much of the swelling
is due to edema and hemorrhage into the soft parts. The
periosteum rarely becomes separated at the line of junction
of the epiphysis and diaphysis. The underlying
blood coagulates rapidly, and the periosteum begins to
calcify within a few weeks, as shown by the X-ray.</p>

<p>The most frequent site of fracture, or separation of<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
the epiphysis, is the lower end of the femur. This may be
accompanied by local swelling, or be discovered at necropsy,
or during life by means of the X-ray in cases in
which it has not been suspected. An interesting fracture
reported by the author, and also mentioned by Kaufmann
and by Schoedel, is that of the head of the femur leading
to the development of coxa vara. In the author&rsquo;s case, the
condition was found in a scorbutic infant who had never
stood on its feet. Schoedel suggests that scurvy may at
times be the etiologic factor in coxa vara as well as in some
cases diagnosed as congenital dislocation of the hip.</p>

<p>On sectioning the bones longitudinally the cortex is
noted to be exceedingly thin, a mere shell and very brittle.
The trabeculæ are so thin and reduced in number that the
bone has become a very fragile structure. The marrow
is no longer deep red at the ends of the long bones, but
yellowish, frequently presenting a patchy appearance.
It has a gelatinous consistency. This &ldquo;Geruestmark&rdquo; is
one of the characteristic anatomical changes of scurvy,
and will be fully described in considering the microscopic
picture. Hemorrhages can be clearly distinguished in
the marrow, and are of varying shades denoting their
irregular occurrence. These hemorrhages were considered
by Looser to be the cause of the connective-tissue formation
in the marrow, but do not occur with sufficient
constancy to warrant this interpretation. Moreover, this
&ldquo;frame-work marrow&rdquo; is found where there is no evidence
of previous hemorrhage.</p>


<h3>MICROSCOPIC PATHOLOGY</h3>

<p><b>Skin.</b>&mdash;As pointed out by Aschoff and Koch, examination
of skin which to gross appearance was the seat of
typical small hemorrhages, showed various lesions. In<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
some, perhaps the most typical forms, there had been a
fresh extravasation of red blood-cells. This condition
is found usually in the subepidermal layers, especially in
the papillary stratum. These small hemorrhages occur
very frequently about the hair follicles and sweat glands,
especially when they have been diseased. Where the
bleeding has been of long standing, dark brownish pigment
deposits are found and all blood-cells may have disappeared.
Phagocytic cells are almost always present and
may be of the &ldquo;wandering&rdquo; or of the more fixed connective-tissue
type. Many round cells may be seen in these
areas lying between the connective-tissue strands or
around the blood-vessels. Rheindorf, as quoted by Tuechler,
has called attention to this round-celled reaction,
which in many instances gives a picture analogous to the
granulomas, and which leads him to infer an infectious
origin for these lesions. Other areas which appeared to
be the seat of hemorrhage are shown by the microscope to
be small abscesses or new connective tissue often loaded
with pigment and detritus, apparently representing the
final stage of these lesions. Aschoff and Koch have found
that suitably-stained preparations frequently show a loss
of elastic fibres, which Rheindorf states constitutes one of
the earliest changes of this disorder. The blood-vessels
in the vicinity of the hemorrhages are congested, especially
the capillaries and small venules.</p>

<p><b>The muscles</b> also present a similar diverse picture
of old and recent hemorrhages, pigment deposit and
round-celled infiltration. Increase of connective tissue is
usually found between the fibre bundles and in some cases
where the hemorrhages are apparently of long standing,
as evidenced by loss of contour of the red cells and pigmentation
of the surrounding areas, this scar tissue formation<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
is very marked. Changes in the muscle fibres
themselves have not been encountered by all observers.
Hayem describes widespread fatty degeneration and a
deposit of pigment within the fibres, Leven a loss of sarcolemma,
while Lasèque and Legroux found fatty changes
which were equally marked in muscles showing no hemorrhage.
On the other hand, Aschoff and Koch, in their
careful studies, did not find noteworthy fatty change of the
fibres, but observed often that the fibres within the hemorrhagic
areas seemed shrunken and were stained abnormally
deep with eosin.</p>

<p>In monkeys dying of experimental scurvy, Hart and
Lessing describe granules in the muscles, which, judged
by their staining affinities, evidently contained calcium and
were similar to those found in the adrenal glands.</p>

<p><b>Blood-vessels.</b>&mdash;A similar difference of opinion obtains
in regard to the changes in the walls of the blood-vessels,
especially of those in hemorrhagic areas. This question is
of particular interest because of its bearing on the problem
of the mechanism involved in the escape of the blood.
Since it has been demonstrated that neither the clotting
time nor the viscosity of the blood is markedly changed
in scurvy but that weakness of the vessel walls exists, as
demonstrated by &ldquo;the capillary resistance test,&rdquo; it is
natural that we should seek an explanation in the microscopic
pathology of the vessels. So far no change has
been found. The application of some of the newer stains,
such as those for mitochondria and other cell granules,
has not been resorted to for this study, and might furnish
valuable information.</p>

<p>Hayem found fatty infiltration of the walls of the small
veins and capillaries, and believed this to play an important
rôle in the etiology of these bleedings. Lasèque and<span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>
Legroux also found occasional fatty changes. Other
authors have failed to demonstrate similar lesions, or have
considered them due to postmortem change. Koch
searched in vain for &ldquo;rents&rdquo; in the vessel walls to account
for the escape of blood. Hyaline degeneration has also
been described, but is believed to result from secondary
infections and not to be an intrinsic lesion of scurvy
(Sato and Nambu, Aschoff and Koch).</p>

<p>Thrombosis of vessels is found both in the neighborhood
of hemorrhage and elsewhere, the thrombi at times
completely occluding the vessels and giving rise to typical
wedge-shaped infarcts. The lung often shows areas of
this kind.</p>

<p><b>Lungs.</b>&mdash;Hemorrhages of various size occur in the tissue
of the lung or in the air spaces. Hemorrhagic infarcts
also have been described, and Sato and Nambu report
hyaline degeneration of the blood-vessel walls. Secondary
pneumonias, usually broncho-pneumonic in type, are of
common occurrence, and in many epidemics constitute the
prevailing cause of death. Tuberculous lesions are also
frequently present, and are stated to assume fresh activity
as the result of the nutritional disorder. Edema
occurs frequently, the fluid in the acini often containing
red blood-cells. Subpleural hemorrhages, thickening of
the pleura, purulent or fibrinous pleurisy are common
lesions.</p>

<p><b>Heart.</b>&mdash;Although hypertrophy and dilatation of the
heart have been noted by several observers, microscopic
changes have rarely been recorded. Meyer, and also
Leven, report fatty degeneration of the muscle fibres,
which, however, was found by Aschoff and Koch in only
one case. Sato and Nambu described an increase of connective<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
tissue, and others anemia and pigmentation.
Thickening of the pericardium and subserous hemorrhages
also occur.</p>


<h3>ALIMENTARY TRACT</h3>

<p><b>Gums.</b>&mdash;Where it has been possible to examine the
gums of early cases, where swelling, redness or bluish discoloration
are the chief symptoms and before secondary
infection has set in, the microscopic picture is very similar
to that of the skin. Small hemorrhages, round-celled infiltration,
increase of connective tissue, clumps of pigment
containing cells, or a diffuse deposit of brownish
granules complete the picture. Congestion and edema
are usually evident. The changes are most pronounced
in the deeper layers of the submucosa and about the
muscles, leaving the superficial layers strikingly intact,
beneath an apparently normal epithelium. In the later
stages, erosion of the mucosa occurs, and the upper layers
of submucosa become involved. Polynuclear cells appear
in great numbers, abscesses and ulcers are formed, which
with proper staining can be shown to harbor the various
types of mouth bacteria, cocci, spirillæ, etc. The pigmentation
becomes intense, and a marked increase of the
newly-formed connective tissue takes place.</p>

<p>The lesions of the stomach are neither characteristic
nor, as a rule, very striking. Hemorrhages occur, the
larger ones generally in the subperitoneal layers, the
smaller ones in any of the coats. Thickening of the wall
follows or accompanies these hemorrhages. Superficial
erosions of the mucosa or even ulcers may be seen.</p>

<p>The striking congestion of the duodenum has been fully
discussed in considering the gross pathology. At any level
in the intestinal tract hemorrhage may take place, with the<span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
resulting pigmentation and scar tissue formation. The
lymphoid structures&mdash;solitary follicles and Peyer&rsquo;s
patches&mdash;are usually intensely congested and often the
seat of hemorrhage. They constitute the sites of predilection
for ulcerative processes of the gut. Bacteria can be
demonstrated at times in the submucous layers; however,
no type has been found to predominate, the flora
being composed of the usual intestinal forms. Aschoff
and Koch have demonstrated in these ulcers the spirilla
and fusiform bacilli so commonly found in the mouth.
These follicular ulcers may be found in any part of the
intestine, and may be shallow erosions, or extend through
the follicle into the deeper tissues. Hemorrhages are
commonly located about the follicles. The epithelial layer
is edematous, often showing an increased number of cells.</p>

<p>The lymph-nodes may be congested, or edematous and
hemorrhagic. Pigment is usually present and in some
cases the peripheral sinus is distended with pigment-loaded
cells. Where secondary infection has occurred,
extensive necrosis of the glands is seen. This is found
frequently in mesenteric nodes where severe intestinal
lesions are present. The nodes lying in the drainage paths
of hemorrhagic areas, especially the inguinal nodes, show
active resorption of blood and blood pigments, and, as
noted above, may be the seat of infection.</p>

<p><b>Liver.</b>&mdash;In this organ, likewise, no change is found with
sufficient regularity to warrant its acceptance as a distinctive
lesion of scurvy. Fatty infiltration is, however,
very common in the centre as well as in the periphery
of the lobules. It is frequently associated with congestion,
which may be so great as to lead to atrophy. In
one case of Aschoff and Koch the picture resembled that
of primary liver atrophy. The organ frequently contains<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
extravasated blood or depositions of old blood pigment.
It should be noted that Boerich described early cirrhosis
in several of his cases, and that Aschoff and Koch record
that one of their severe, acute cases showed &ldquo;a recent
cellular cirrhosis.&rdquo; An exceptional lesion is reported
by Reinert&mdash;a &ldquo;leucocytic&rdquo; infiltration of the liver and
spleen occurring in a three-year-old child, and resembling
that seen in pseudoleukæmia. Finally, it should be remembered
in this connection that Hart and Lessing found
calcium deposits not only in the muscles and adrenal
glands of their monkeys, but also in the liver.</p>

<p><b>The spleen</b> shares the general congestion of the internal
organs. Sato and Nambu invariably found large numbers
of pigment granules in this organ. Hirschsprung
noted many Malpighian corpuscles, Reinert describes a
true hyperplasia of the splenic pulp, and others mention
infarcts and subcapsular hemorrhages.</p>

<p><b>The kidneys</b> are often normal. On the other hand,
various forms of nephritis are found, with cloudy swelling
or interstitial change&mdash;a not infrequent complication of
scurvy. More typical of the primary disease are congestion
and hemorrhages, the bleedings occurring either
under the capsule, into the interstitial tissues, or into the
lumina of the tubules. Hayem found fatty infiltration
of this organ and Aschoff and Koch a slight change of this
kind in one case.</p>

<p><b>Adrenals.</b>&mdash;A new interest in the study of the adrenals
in diseases of the &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo; group has been created by
the recent work of McCarrison. This author found the
adrenals increased in size and weight in guinea-pigs dying
of scurvy, whereas the adrenalin content of these glands
was markedly decreased. On section there was hemorrhagic
infiltration, &ldquo;usually circumscribed in extent and<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
situated around the periphery of the adrenal cortex.&rdquo;
This was seen even in early cases before hemorrhage had
occurred elsewhere in the body. He describes also &ldquo;degenerative
changes in the cellular elements of cortex and
medulla&rdquo; consisting of vacuolation and disintegration of
the cells with disappearance or loss of staining reactions
of their nuclei. Rondoni, some years previously, had
called attention to this increase in size and hyperæmia of
the adrenals in guinea-pigs fed exclusively cereal diets.
He, as well as McCarrison, noted an increase, though
much less marked, as the result of starvation. LaMer
and Campbell recently have confirmed McCarrison&rsquo;s report
of an augmentation in the weight of the adrenal
glands in guinea-pigs fed on diets deficient in the antiscorbutic
factor.</p>

<p>Comparable lesions have as yet not been found in
human scurvy. These glands have been found normal by
Jacobsthal, Schoedel and Nauwerk, Ingier and Epstein.
In the cases of Aschoff and Koch no abnormality was
noted except an almost constant increase in lipoid content.
In those of Boerich the glands were normal in all but one
case; in this instance the medulla was somewhat increased
in size. In passing, we may repeat that Hart and Lessing
found calcium deposits in the adrenals of four of their five
monkeys, a lesion which has never been recorded in man.</p>

<p>It is valuable in this connection to compare the adrenal
in scurvy with that of beriberi. In this disorder, Albert
found the adrenal normal in one case, and Andrews describes
only congestion in his eighteen necropsies. Ono
found an increased adrenalin content in nine fatal cases,
and states that the medulla appeared &ldquo;fatter&rdquo; than normal.
More data will have to be obtained before it can be
determined whether characteristic changes occur in<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
scurvy, and how to interpret the hypertrophy described
by several authors as common to guinea-pig scurvy.</p>

<p><b>Pancreas.</b>&mdash;Sato and Nambu appear to be the only
investigators who have described lesions in the pancreas.
They found hemorrhages in one case among thirteen.</p>

<p><b>Thymus.</b>&mdash;This organ has rarely been examined.
Aschoff and Koch found no abnormalities in adults, nor
did Jacobsthal in a case of infantile scurvy. Boerich
noted enlargement in one instance.</p>

<p><b>Other Organs of Internal Secretion.</b>&mdash;Very little attention
has been paid to these organs. Aschoff and Koch state
that the thyroids and hypophyses were normal in
their cases.</p>

<p><b>Generative Organs.</b>&mdash;No abnormalities have been
described.</p>

<p><b>Central Nervous System.</b>&mdash;The most frequent abnormality
of the central nervous system is, as would be expected,
hemorrhage; this has been discussed in the section dealing
with gross pathology. No specific changes have been
found in nerve-cells or fibres of the brain.</p>

<p>In a case of fatal scurvy in an infant a &ldquo;focal degeneration
of the lumbar cord&rdquo; has been described,
extending for a distance of about a quarter of an inch
(Hess). The lesion differed from that of poliomyelitis
in the absence of round-celled infiltration and of the characteristic
changes in the anterior horn cells (Figs. 3
and 4). The outstanding feature was a loss of cells in the
lateral groups of the left anterior horn; there were also
fewer nerve fibres in this region, but this diminution was
less striking. No definite interpretation of this case can
be made as the data are insufficient to permit a conclusion
as to whether the lesion was truly scorbutic or the
result of an associated process. Schoedel and Nauwerk<span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
found no change in the spinal cord stained by
Marchi&rsquo;s method.</p>

<p><b>Peripheral Nerves.</b>&mdash;The sheaths of the large nerves as
well as those of the vessels are very often invaded by
hemorrhage. The extravasated blood is found to lie
around but rarely among the nerve fibres, which do not
show any pathological alteration. Ingier is one of the
very few to describe a degeneration of the nerve fibres.
In one guinea-pig in which scurvy was induced she found
&ldquo;many marked degenerated fibrillar bundles of both sciatic
and peroneal nerves, slight degeneration of the
phrenic nerves and one vagus and its cardiac branch.&rdquo;
Another animal is referred to as having shown &ldquo;very
marked and well-developed degeneration of the nerves of
the lower extremities.&rdquo; It is open to question whether
starvation played a rôle in the causation of these lesions.
Schoedel and Nauwerk, and Aschoff and Koch examined
these nerves but failed to find any lesions; the latter
directed their attention especially to the vagus of twenty-two
cases.</p>

<p><b>Retinal hemorrhages</b> were found by Jacobsthal, and by
Kitamura, who records &ldquo;decided edema of the retina,
marked bleeding and circumscribed hypertrophy of the
nerve fibres&rdquo; such as is found in albuminuric retinitis.
These changes are considered again under the symptomatology
of scurvy.</p>

<p><b>Bones.</b>&mdash;Our knowledge of the minute pathology of
the bones is far more complete and detailed than that of
any other structure. This was to be expected in view of
the fact that this is the only tissue in which the lesions
are diagnostic. In considering the microscopic pathology
it must be remembered that all the bones are rarely
affected by scurvy, and that those that are involved show<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
the scorbutic changes to a varying degree. One of the
peculiarities of the lesion is that it involves the end of
the diaphysis or rather the junction of the diaphysis and
the cartilage. The bones most apt to show typical changes
are the ribs; we shall therefore describe a section made
through a costochondral junction.</p>

<p>The costochondral junction is generally swollen, somewhat
beaded, and when cut longitudinally shows on gross
examination a transverse yellowish bar, corresponding
to the area of disorganization which will be described
below. Under the microscope the line of juncture is not
sharp and straight as is normally the case, but presents
a wavy or irregular contour, the cartilage jutting into the
bony end of the rib, instead of abutting in neat apposition
to it. The bone is hollowed out and irregularly concave,
whereas the cartilage presents a convex appearance. At
the site of the junction is the <i>Truemmerfeld area</i>, where
the normal tissue is splintered and fragmented. Everything
in a state of disorder&mdash;trabeculæ of bone of various
shapes and sizes lie scattered about, the cells irregularly
arranged and much distorted, signs of recent hemorrhage,
unrecognizable detritus. The picture is that of weakened
bone having been crushed by the pressure of the more compact
cartilage. Higher magnification shows that there
are few osteoblasts (generally associated with the deeper
fragments of bone), a varying number of intact red cells,
according to the occurrence of hemorrhage, and occasional
spindle- and star-shaped connective-tissue cells. Covering
this mass of detritus there is frequently, as Aschoff
and Koch have emphasized, more or less protective fibrin
which has undergone some hyaline or connective-tissue
organization.</p>

<p>The cartilage is also not normal. Its cells do not present<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
an orderly arrangement, the proliferating columns having
disappeared in the central convex portion, and being present
to a varying extent near the periosteal borders. If we
judge from sections of early scurvy in guinea-pigs, this
disturbance of the columnar formation of the proliferating
cartilage is one of the early signs of scurvy, and is associated
with an unevenness and irregularity in shape and
size of the bone trabeculæ. In young individuals, where
cartilage activity is great, these changes are most
marked and the entire zone of active cells may be
somewhat widened.</p>

&ldquo;Truemmerfeld&rdquo; (b) hemorrhage in the fibrous marrow (Gernest-mark). Bone cortex and
trabeculae abnormally thin. McCallums&rsquo; Text Book of Pathology. W. B. Saunders Co.
</div>

<p>Below the Truemmerfeld is the <i>Geruestmark or framework
marrow</i>, another distinguishing feature of scurvy.
This extends for about 5 to 10 mm. toward the lymphoid
marrow, where it ends more or less abruptly. It is composed
of a loosely-constructed fibrillar tissue on a gelatinous-appearing
groundwork, of sparsely scattered cells,
and bony trabeculæ which are markedly thin and weak.
Here and there are hemorrhages and blood pigment, especially
adjacent to the &ldquo;Truemmerfeld.&rdquo; Another feature
which strikes one at first glance is that the entire marrow
area is incompletely filled by the thin and greatly-depleted
trabeculæ of the spongiosa. The question has been raised
whether this rarification is to be considered entirely of
scorbutic origin. It is due evidently to a lack of function
of the osteoblasts, which are diminished in number, and
are represented by a layer of shrivelled spindle cells along
the walls of the atrophied bony columns. They may fail
almost entirely, as may its osteoid border, which is significant
of active bone tissue. The lack of bony structure
and rarification clearly is not due to an increase in the
number or the function of the osteoclasts, for these do not
appear in excess. It is mainly the result of normal bone<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
resorption with a lack of normal bone regeneration.
Aschoff and Koch suggest that the framework marrow
may be able to manufacture bone, but cannot accomplish
this because there is a lack of material from which to
make osteoid tissue. This, they believe, constitutes the
primary deficiency&mdash;a lack or faulty development of
cement substance, which in turn may depend on an alteration
of colloid material. Regarded in this light, the lesions
of the bones resulting in fracture and those of the blood-vessels
resulting in rupture and hemorrhage are dependent
on a deficiency of the same basic material.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage occurs in the bone as elsewhere; it is
almost never lacking. It appears either as large hemorrhages
in the spongiosa, especially where the normal marrow
joins either the Geruestmark or the Truemmerfeld,
or merely as scattered cells, possibly the result of diapedesis.
The blood-vessels in these areas are narrow and
extremely thin-walled. The most typical site of hemorrhage
is beneath the periosteum, a lesion widely known
on account of its clinical significance (<a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>). Here the
blood may extend for a considerable distance along the
shaft, but rarely beyond the epiphyseal line. The clot
forms readily, demonstrating that the nature of the hemorrhage
is not a defect in coagulation, and in its midst may
be seen fibrin, pigment, granulation tissue, and more or
less firm connective tissue&mdash;constituting the callus. The
inner surface of the periosteum is frequently lined with
newly-formed bone and with a more or less dense deposition
of lime salts, which becomes heavier in the course of
the healing process, and is readily observed in radiographs.
This periostitis ossificans may result in the clot
being surrounded by a perfect shell of bone, with bony
columns penetrating the deeper layers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span></p>
<p>As the result of the lack of bone formation and the
consequent weakening of the corticalis and the spongiosa,
frequently a separation of the diaphysis from the
epiphysis results. This lesion should not be regarded as a
true separation, for, as Barlow pointed out, the line of
cleavage is not at the junction, but below it, involving the
uppermost region of the diaphysis. It is therefore correct
to speak of a fracture or infraction. This lesion is generally
accompanied by a deformity of the surface contour
of the junction, due to a displacement of the cartilage, as
a result of which &ldquo;angular beading&rdquo; of the rib is brought
about. In some instances the cartilage is &ldquo;telescoped&rdquo;
into the crushed end of the bone. To a varying extent
fibrin covers the end of the fractured bone; the angles
adjacent to the periosteum contain blood which becomes
organized into dense connective tissue, thus serving as a
splint for the fractured parts. In the course of healing
a large number of foreign body giant-cells appear, blood-vessels
sprout from the periosteum as well as the bony
surface, and the necrosed tissue gives place to an active
formation of callus, which generally leads to complete
regeneration and restitution. It is remarkable how quickly
and perfectly an epiphysis may become reunited to its
shaft (Figs. 6 and 7). Sometimes, however, this takes
place with resulting deformity, as in the development of
coxa vara of the femur.</p>

<p>As Czerny and Keller have stated, it is difficult to
define sharply the relation of bone fragility to scurvy.
Histologically there is great similarity between the
&ldquo;osteotabes infantum&rdquo; described by Ziegler and conditions
sometimes found in infantile scurvy. The main distinction
is that in the latter disorder the lesion is less
generally distributed throughout the skeleton, and is particularly<span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
marked in a limited area of the bones (epiphyses).
In considering this question it should be borne
in mind that, experimentally, osteoporosis and scurvy can
be brought about by diets which are absolutely dissimilar.
For example, Bartenstein showed that young guinea-pigs
develop osteoporosis and multiple fractures on a diet of
raw milk containing an adequate quota of antiscorbutic
vitamine.</p>

<p><b>Rickets</b> and infantile scurvy are commonly found associated,
although they bear no causal relationship to each
other. The distinctive characteristic of rickets is the
broad area of osteoid tissue which is formed at the
epiphyseal junction, a broad band of incompletely calcified
cartilage not found in scurvy. In the latter disease osteoblastic
bone growth is greatly inhibited, but what growth
does take place occurs in a normal and orderly manner.
The osteophytes, for example, which so commonly develop
at right angles to the axis of the bone in the subperiosteal
hemorrhages, are composed of apparently normal bone.
Another marked distinction between the two conditions is
the paucity of blood-vessels in the cartilaginous area and
in the marrow in scurvy, compared with the increased vascularity
so generally encountered in rickets. It is evident,
therefore, that although these two nutritional disorders
bear a superficial resemblance to each other pathologically,
they are radically different and almost antithetical.</p>

<h2><span class="fs85">CHAPTER V</span><br />
EXPERIMENTAL SCURVY</h2>


<p>There is no mention whatsoever of scurvy in animals
previous to 1895, when Theobald Smith wrote: &ldquo;When
guinea-pigs are fed with cereal (it has been observed for
some years in this laboratory), with bran and oats mixed,
without any grass, clover, or succulent vegetable, such
as cabbage, a peculiar disease, chiefly recognizable by
subcutaneous extravasations of blood, carries them off in
from four to eight weeks.&rdquo; Smith did not pursue the
subject further.</p>

<p>Coincident with the appreciation of the value of
experimental methods, one would have expected attempts
to produce scurvy in animals. The disorder had been
recognized for a great many years, the fact that it was
occasioned by a dietary deficient in fresh food was widely
known, so that it would seem natural for clinicians or
laboratory workers to have tried to induce the disease in
animals by a similar restricted diet. There is, however,
no suggestion of such an experiment in the voluminous
literature on scurvy. The explanation of the neglect of an
experimental study of scurvy appears to be that this was
considered a disorder which required little investigation&mdash;its
etiology, its prevention and its cure seemed thoroughly
understood. It is strange that the mere fact that such a
severe disturbance responded, as if by magic, to the
administration of simple foodstuffs should not have
awakened curiosity as well as wonder, and stimulated
inquiry into the nature and significance of the curative
agent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span></p>
<p>In 1903 Bolle published the results of experiments on
guinea-pigs which had been fed for various periods on
raw or sterilized milk. He reported that the animals
developed a marked fragility of the bones, varying in
intensity in proportion to the degree of heat to which the
milk had been subjected. These changes Bolle interpreted
as typical scurvy, but it is difficult to decide whether
the disorder was actually true scurvy, in view of the
indefinite description of the bone lesions.</p>

<p>Bartenstein repeated Bolle&rsquo;s work and described in
detail the changes in the bones. From his work we
learned that it was of little moment whether the animals
were fed raw or sterilized milk&mdash;their nutrition failed
within about the same length of time, and they died
within a month. The chief pathologic change was a
marked fragility of the bones, leading to spontaneous
fractures, or to breaking of the bones in the course of
ordinary manipulation. Bartenstein described the disorder
as &ldquo;beginning with the degeneration of the marrow,
and secondarily leading to an atrophy of the bone
due to increased absorption and deficient new formation
of bone, especially at the endochondral lines of ossification.
As the result of the osteoporosis, spontaneous fractures
occur without noticeable hemorrhagic diathesis.&rdquo;
He found a deficiency of calcium in the bones of animals
suffering from even a mild degree of this disorder. Hart
and Lessing are of the opinion that we cannot accept
Bartenstein&rsquo;s diagnosis of scurvy. They compare this
disorder to that described by Ziegler as &ldquo;osteotabes infantum,&rdquo;
in which there is a more or less pronounced
&ldquo;jelly marrow&rdquo; which has replaced the lymphoid cells in
scattered areas. They sum up their analysis of the question
with the statement that &ldquo;the primary marrow changes<span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>
in the diaphysis, the marked lacunar absorption by osteoclasts,
the absence of subperiosteal hemorrhages, do not
indicate typical scurvy.&rdquo; Schmorl produced comparable
lesions in dogs and came to the conclusion that the disorder
was one &ldquo;very similar&rdquo; to scurvy but not identical
with it, the essential difference being that in all animals
there was a most marked absorption of bone by osteoclasts.</p>

<p>Similar results were obtained by others. In 1904
Peiper and Eichloff attempted to produce scurvy in dogs
by means of a diet composed exclusively of raw or of
sterilized milk. The following year we find a report by
Esser of feeding goats on sterilized milk. None of these
studies hits the mark; a condition of fragilitas ossium was
produced rather than typical scurvy.</p>

<p>In 1907 the first systematic and convincing experimental
study of scurvy appeared. In this year Holst
and Froelich published a preliminary account of their
classic work, undertaken in an endeavor to fathom the
nature of &ldquo;ship beriberi,&rdquo; a disorder which disabled so
many of the sailors in the Norwegian navy. We must
remember that until recently attention has been focussed
on the infectious diseases, and little thought given to the
investigation of nutritional disorders. Although experimental
investigation in this field may be stated to have
been initiated by this work, it in turn had been stimulated
by a conception of dietary diseases which had just begun
to be realized. This new viewpoint was the result of the
work of Eijkman. As has been mentioned in considering
the pathogenesis of human scurvy, Eijkman demonstrated
that hens developed polyneuritis, a disease resembling
beriberi, when fed on polished rice, and that the
simple change to a diet of unpolished rice, or the addition
of rice polishings to the dietary, sufficed to protect or to<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
cure. This work had been repeated and substantiated.
It was evident to those who considered the question that
the old lines of thought in regard to food and dietetics
inadequately explained remarkable phenomena of this
kind. It was also clear that nutritional disorders were
subject to experimental investigation in a way similar
to the infectious diseases, which were absorbing the interest
of the various laboratories. It is unnecessary to review
the rapid rise of investigative work in this field. It may
be stated, in general, that during the past few years the
investigations of scurvy have become so numerous that
an established research technic may be said to have
developed in connection with its study.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to produce scurvy in various
animals, but it has been brought about regularly only in
the guinea-pig and in the monkey. Experiments on the
dog are as yet too few to justify our regarding this animal
as definitely available for this study. The nutrition of
rats, mice, rabbits, hogs, pigeons, fowl, receiving a diet
identical with that which regularly occasions scurvy in
guinea-pigs, either progresses normally or a state of malnutrition
develops which cannot be identified with scurvy.
Recently Hart, Steenbock and Smith have reported that
cattle can be reared to maturity on a diet which will
produce scurvy in the guinea-pig in four to five weeks.
We are therefore confronted with the remarkable and
inexplicable phenomenon, a fact concurred in by almost all
investigators, that a diet induces either normal nutrition
or malnutrition, according to the experimental animal
employed. A diet of polished rice, or other decorticated
grain, will lead to the development of scurvy in the guinea-pig,
to polyneuritis in the pigeon or fowl, or, according
to Holst and Froelich, to a combination of these disorders<span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>
in the hog.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> The basis of these divergent results cannot
be surmised, and is worthy of the most thorough investigation.
It may well be that the elucidation of this problem&mdash;for
example, why we are able to bring about scurvy
in the guinea-pig but not in the rabbit, will shed light on
the pathogenesis of this disorder. Are we to conclude that
some of these animals have the power to synthesize the
vitamine whereas others must depend upon the food for it,
or are we to presuppose an ability to maintain normal life
and function without any or with a minimal amount of
this vitamine? The difference between these two groups,
the susceptible and non-susceptible animals, probably is
not as absolute as we have been wont to regard it. Recently
Harden and Zilva have shown that although rats are
able to thrive on a diet free from antiscorbutic vitamine,
they show an appreciable gain in weight when this factor
is added to the dietary. If such be proved to be the case,
we must regard the non-susceptibility of the rat, the rabbit,
etc., as relative rather than absolute.</p>

<p>From time to time a doubt has been raised as to
whether we should accept guinea-pig scurvy as the counterpart
of human scurvy. This question can be answered
only by comparing the disorder in the one species with
that in the other&mdash;as to mode of production, pathology,
symptomatology, means of cure and all other phenomena.
Viewed from these standpoints it is found that in almost
every respect the disorder is identical in man and in the
guinea-pig. The outstanding distinction is the difference
in the length of time elapsing before the development of
symptoms. In the child or in the adult it takes about<span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>
six months of the deficient diet before clinical symptoms
are manifest and a diagnosis can be established; in the
guinea-pig the disorder can be recognized two weeks after
restricting the diet. In the one instance we seem to be
dealing with a nutritional disorder which is chronic or at
least subacute, and in the other with a markedly acute
condition. This distinction is open, however, to certain
qualifications. In the first place, we must consider the
duration of life of the two species, the comparatively short
span of the guinea-pig compared with that of man. It
must be borne in mind, furthermore, that the guinea-pig is
placed on a diet absolutely devoid of all antiscorbutic vitamine,
whereas this rarely obtains in human beings. For
example, the diet which is most markedly scorbutic for
infants is the &ldquo;malt soup&rdquo; previously mentioned, but
even this food contains an amount of the antiscorbutic
factor which is not negligible. But after taking these
differences into consideration, it is nevertheless evident
that the guinea-pig is far more sensitive to scurvy than
man. This does not indicate that the guinea-pig is an unsuitable
experimental animal, any more than the fact that
the pigeon is more susceptible to polyneuritis than man
indicates that it is unsuited to investigations of beriberi.
It merely prevents our carrying out delicate quantitative
experiments, and cautions against drawing too finely-spun
deductions. In all nutritional investigations it
should never be forgotten that conclusions drawn from
experiments on animals are merely provisional, and must
await substantiation on man, and, furthermore, that where
differences in reaction are noted, the clinical data should
be accorded full consideration.</p>

<p><b>Pathogenesis of Guinea-pig Scurvy.</b>&mdash;From a pathogenetic
point of view guinea-pig scurvy and human scurvy<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
show remarkable points in common. Any diet that leads
to the development of scurvy in man likewise brings it
about in the guinea-pig, and contrariwise, any food which
cures the disorder has the same beneficent effect on both
species. This similarity extends so far that, as will be
shown in the chapter on antiscorbutics, the relative potency
of the various foods is approximately the same for
man and for the guinea-pig. The parallelism generally is
striking. The dietary which has been commonly employed
in experimental scurvy has been that first suggested by
Holst and Froelich, namely, oats, hay and water. Recently,
however, this dietary has been enlarged in order to
make it more complete, so as to include adequate protein,
water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamine, and inorganic
salts. To this end the group of workers at the Lister
Institute (Chick and co-workers, Harden and Zilva) place
their animals on a basal diet of one part of crushed oats
and two of wheaten bran, and a daily ration of 50 to 60 c.c.
of milk autoclaved for one hour at 120° C. This milk
still retains a small amount of antiscorbutic vitamine.
Cohen and Mendel have employed, apparently with good
result, a &ldquo;soy bean cracker,&rdquo; containing soy bean flour
which has been heated for 30 minutes at 15 pounds&rsquo; pressure
(120° C.), 3 per cent. of sodium chloride, the same
percentage of calcium lactate and of dried brewers&rsquo; yeast,
and raw milk sufficient to supply 5 per cent. of butter-fat.</p>

<p>The use of raw milk was introduced by Jackson and
Moore, and adopted by McCollum and Pitz and again by
Pitz in a series of interesting experiments. The milk was
given <i>ad libitum</i>. The results of these investigations were
puzzling at first, until it was shown by Chick, Hume and
Skelton that the dietary on which they were based contained
a fundamental error which accounted for their lack<span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
of consistence. Although milk is not rich in the antiscorbutic
factor, it possesses it in moderate degree, so that
the outcome will be quite different according to whether a
guinea-pig takes, for example, 50 c.c. or 100 c.c. daily.
It is quite evident, therefore, that a food of this kind cannot
be offered <i>ad libitum</i>, and that if this rule is not observed,
most disconcerting results will follow.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> This basic
error in framing the dietary has made it impossible to
accept the deductions of these authors. The conclusions
of McCollum and Pitz are so striking and have led to such
wide discussion, that they require consideration, in spite
of the fact that the error in the dietary is now recognized.
These authors found that the cæcum of their animals was
greatly distended with putrefying fæces. As the cæcum is
extraordinarily large and delicate in this species, they
drew the deduction that the development of scurvy in
the guinea-pig was due principally to the retention of
fæces. &ldquo;An impacted cæcum, the seat of putrefaction,
may cause injury to the cæcal wall, sufficient to permit the
invasion of the tissues by bacteria, or the animals may
perhaps be injured primarily by the absorption of toxic
products of bacterial origin.&rdquo; Accessory dietary factors
or vitamines, according to this theory, are supposed to
play no part in the disorder, and antiscorbutics, such as<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
orange juice, are considered to owe their efficacy mainly
to their laxative properties, and to be replaceable by other
laxatives such as phenolphthalein or oleum petrolatum.
The efficacy of orange juice is supposed to be due to its
content of citrates, and to be replaceable by what was
termed &ldquo;artificial orange juice,&rdquo; a mixture composed of
the various salts, citric acid and sucrose, in the proportions
in which they are found in the natural juice.</p>

<p>These reports stimulated renewed interest in experimental
scurvy, suggesting new aspects, and therefore
directing attention to points requiring investigation.
There were no data at hand on the consistency of the
contents of the bowel in guinea-pigs, so that it was necessary
to make appropriate observations in normal and in
scorbutic animals. It was soon reported by various
workers, Rappleye, Cohen and Mendel, Hess and Unger,
and others, that there was no definite relationship between
the occurrence of scurvy and impaction of the cæcum. In
<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a> we see portrayed the stool output of a guinea-pig
during the period in which it was developing scurvy, and
during a subsequent period when it was being cured by
means of orange juice. It is clear that there was no significant
variation in the output during these divergent
periods. A similar conclusion was arrived at by those
who examined the cæcums of animals postmortem. Cohen
and Mendel write: &ldquo;Summarizing our experience with
nearly one hundred scorbutic animals, we conclude that
actual impaction of the fæces in the cæcum occurred in
about one-quarter of the cases, and visible damage to wall,
<i>i.e.</i>, congestion or hemorrhage, or impaction, or both, was
found in perhaps half of the cases. It should be noted
that this statement covers all the diets we have tried.&rdquo;
We concur in this conclusion. Not infrequently we found<span class="pagenum" title="120"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>
the cæcums of markedly scorbutic pigs to contain semi-fluid
fæces, the consistency of its contents depending on
the character of the diet, quite apart from its adequacy
and lack of the antiscorbutic factor. For example, a diet
rich in milk, containing 100 c.c. or more, led to the formation
of rather solid fæces; if oats were added to the
milk diet the fæces in the cæcum were found to be still more
solid, and this portion of the gut more often impacted.
This condition could be detected by palpation even during
life. Just as we encountered scorbutic animals on an oat,
hay and water diet, who had semi-fluid fæces in the cæcums,
so we met with others which were on a milk diet, and
showed no signs of scurvy, although their cæcums were
impacted with fæces of a putty-like consistence. Guinea-pigs<span class="pagenum" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>
do not seem to be able to tolerate a diet containing
a large quantity of the fat of cow&rsquo;s milk. Such a diet leads
to impaction of the large intestine resulting in death, but
does not induce scurvy. Jackson and Moore produced a
condition of this kind by feeding pigs with cream containing
26 to 28 per cent. fat. &ldquo;In every case,&rdquo; they write,
&ldquo;the large intestine was distended with light mustard-colored
semi-solid fæces.&rdquo; This pathological condition is
not understood, but is quite distinct from scurvy, and
remarkable in view of the fact that the milk of the guinea-pig
contains as high as 25 per cent. of fat. It is an interesting
illustration of the marked biological difference in
the butter-fat of various species.</p>

<a id="Fig_8"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Shows a period with the development of scurvy, and one where it was
cured by giving orange juice. It will be noted that there was no marked constipation
while the animal had scurvy. During a period of a few days the amount
of stool was scanty, corresponding to the decreased intake of oats and hay on
the days preceding. Broken line represents clinical course of scurvy.
</div>

<p>Nor was it found, as McCollum and Pitz claimed, that
antiscorbutics were replaceable by laxatives in the diet.
Without entering into the details of this aspect of the
subject, which will be considered in the chapter on symptomatology,
it may be stated that attempts to prevent the
occurrence of scurvy or to cure it by means of laxatives
invariably failed. Chick, Hume and Skelton, as well as
Hess and Unger, gave oleum petrolatum to a series of
pigs without the slightest favorable effect. Hart, Steenbock
and Smith recently reported that they had administered
1 c.c. of this oil on alternate days to one series of
pigs, and 2 <ins title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: originally mgm.">mg.</ins> of phenolphthalein on alternate days
to another series, without relieving the scurvy. Cohen and
Mendel, in order to test the adequacy of their diet as to
roughage, supplemented it with additions of considerable
filter paper and sawdust, &ldquo;without averting the appearance
of scurvy.&rdquo; It is evident, therefore, that constipation
does not play an essential rôle in the pathogenesis
of scurvy in the guinea-pig, and that antiscorbutics are
by no means synonymous or interchangeable with laxatives.<span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>
These results accord with observations on infantile
scurvy.</p>

<p><b>The Pathology.</b>&mdash;The pathology of guinea-pig scurvy is
essentially that of human scurvy. Hemorrhages and separations
of the epiphyses or fractures of the long bones
dominate the macroscopic picture. The hemorrhages
are found rarely in the gums, but are common about the
joints, in the muscles of the jaw or in those of the hind
legs. They may be subcutaneous and appear as bluish
discolorations at various parts of the body, especially if
the disorder has resulted in death or if infection has been
superadded. On stripping the skin we often note hemorrhages
in the intercostal muscles, and beading of the ribs
at the site of the costochondral junctions, least marked in
the upper and in the floating ribs. This has been frequently
described in connection with guinea-pig scurvy;
its similarity to the rosary of human rickets has been
drawn attention to recently by Jackson and Moore. It
should not be regarded as &ldquo;pseudo-rhachitic,&rdquo; but as
typically scorbutic, from a microscopic as well as a macroscopic
viewpoint. On closer examination a yellowish-white
transverse line may be seen at the epiphyseal
junction of the ribs, and frequently some subperiosteal
hemorrhage. Beading of this character has been reported
by Ingier also in the &ldquo;snuffles&rdquo; of hogs and as the result
of trauma. A similar enlargement of the chondral junctions
of the sternum may be found on examining its posterior
surface.</p>

<p><i>The joints</i> of the body always show some changes. The
epiphyses are enlarged to a variable degree, resembling
the epiphyses typical of human rickets. As in infants,
this change is met with most commonly at the wrist joint,
involving the ulna and the radius. The knee-joint is likewise<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
often involved, especially the ends of the tibia; the
elbow, ankle, and the shoulder may also show an articular
swelling of the bones. About these joints hemorrhages
in the subcutaneous tissues may be seen, or edema extending
along the extremities. Not infrequently a fracture of
one of the long bones is found, which may or may not have
been diagnosed during life. The common site of fracture
is the lower part of the tibia or fibula. Much more frequent
than fractures are separations of the epiphyses,
which long since have been recognized as typical of infantile
scurvy. Even gentle handling in the course of performing
the necropsy may occasion a lesion of this kind&mdash;of
the tibia at the knee, of the radius or ulna at the wrist,
or indeed at any of the epiphyseal junctions. The infracted
ends occasionally may be seen held insecurely
by a delicate band of periosteum. The shafts of the bones
are brittle, rarefied, and easily broken.</p>

<p>On opening <i>the chest</i>, slight hemorrhages may be noted
in the pericardium and in the visceral and costal pleuræ.
The heart is frequently enlarged, and the pericardial sac
contains an excess of serum; the right ventricle, however,
is not found disproportionately hypertrophied. Pneumonia
is met with very frequently and constitutes a common
terminal infection.</p>

<p>On opening <i>the abdomen</i> we may note subperitoneal
hemorrhages of the muscular wall or of the coils of intestine.
The liver and spleen are generally normal, as is the
pancreas. The kidney frequently shows minute hemorrhages
beneath the capsule and on section.</p>

<p><i>The adrenals</i> not infrequently are large. This fact
was first brought out by Rondoni and Montagnani, and is
of added interest in view of its confirmation by McCarrison
as well as by LaMer and Campbell. Its significance<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
is discussed at length in the consideration of the adrenal
gland in human scurvy. In view of the fact that fasting
leads to a similar hypertrophy, and that guinea-pig scurvy
frequently is complicated by fasting, these observations
should be extended. In all investigations of this kind,
bacterial cultures should be taken of the adrenals, or
other organs, to be certain that there is no complicating
infection.</p>

<p>There have been no reports as to the effect of scurvy
on the size of the testicles, ovary, thymus, thyroid or
parathyroid glands in the guinea-pig, such as have been
made by McCarrison in relation to avian polyneuritis.</p>

<p><i>The alimentary tract</i> occasionally shows macroscopic
changes similar to the lesions found in man. The entire
canal is frequently very empty, especially the stomach and
the small intestine, due to the lack of appetite for some
days previous to death. In the stomach we may find
areas of congestion or numerous small superficial ulcers
surrounded by congestion and covered with mucus; occasionally
these ulcers are somewhat larger and deeper.
The larger ulcers are more frequently situated in the first
part of the duodenum, often proximal to the papilla of
Vater. Holst and Froelich described this lesion in one of
their early communications. More common than ulceration
of the duodenum is a diffuse congestion of its upper
part. This lesion is of note because it has been described
frequently in the protocols of human necropsies, and is
found in beriberi, in avian polyneuritis, and in pellagra
in man. Its significance is unknown, and has indeed never
been discussed.</p>

<p>Lower down in the bowel there are occasionally areas
of congestion and ulceration, but no section seems particularly
predisposed to these lesions. The contents of the<span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>
bowel, especially of the cæcum, as mentioned above, depend
more on the character of the food than on the existence
of scurvy. If the diet has consisted of milk and oats,
the cæcum will be found full and perhaps impacted,
whereas if hay and oats have been fed, the cæcum will be
less full and its contents semisolid.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that many of the animals have taken
very little food for some days previous to their death, it
will be well to describe briefly the macroscopic picture of
<i>simple starvation</i> in guinea-pigs. When guinea-pigs are
given only water they live about one week; if orange juice
is added to this water diet they succumb a little later to
starvation. Under all these conditions the striking pathologic
change&mdash;absent in scurvy&mdash;is edema. It is true
that the limbs may show slight edema in scurvy, and that
the pericardial and the pleural sacs, and even the peritoneal
cavity, occasionally contain a small quantity of
serum, but it is comparatively an insignificant amount.
Moreover it is difficult to decide to what extent this edema
is due to scurvy, and to what extent to starvation. In
typical starvation, on the other hand, such as occurs on
the limited diets enumerated above, we find marked
subcutaneous edema, sometimes a true anasarca, and frequently
also ascites. We are reminded of the &ldquo;war
edema&rdquo; and its frequent association with starvation.
Another distinction between the two conditions is the fact
that the marrow in starvation is yellow and not red as
in scurvy. In passing, it may be mentioned that the
ascites was greater when orange juice had been given than
where the animal received only water.</p>

<p>In perusing the literature but one study has been noted
on <i>the effect of a scorbutic diet on the f&oelig;tus</i>. This investigation<span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>
was carried out on a large series of guinea-pigs by
Ingier (1915). The following comprise her conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;1. Pronounced cases of Barlow&rsquo;s disease may be produced
in the f&oelig;tus as early as ten to fifteen days after
the commencement of dieting pregnant guinea-pigs with
oats and water. There are wide individual variations.
The scorbutic changes in the skeleton are greatest in the
earlier embryonic stages. The f&oelig;tuses of that period,
with practically no exceptions, die and show marked traces
of impeded growth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2. F&oelig;tuses from the later period of pregnancy are
born alive, and apparently fully developed, with comparatively
slight changes in the osseous system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;3. Even a short extension of the period of extra-uterine
dieting on milk from scorbutic mothers, and later
on oats and water, is sufficient to change the latent scurvy
into a highly-pronounced case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;4. The f&oelig;tus cannot be kept alive longer than the
adult animal, about twenty-eight days, either by intra-uterine
dieting alone or by combined intra- and extra-uterine
dieting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;5. The mothers show signs of the disease at an early
period and are more severely attacked than non-pregnant
animals. Death also occurs comparatively often in the
first period of gestation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In these experiments intra-uterine fractures, premature
births and still-born litters are frequently mentioned.
This suggests naturally an inquiry as to whether similar
occurrences have been observed in human scurvy. In
considering the pathogenesis of human scurvy, we have
remarked on the meagreness of the data on this most
interesting aspect of this disorder. In view of the similarity
between human and guinea-pig scurvy, we should<span class="pagenum" title="127"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>
expect not only miscarriages and still-births to result,
but cases of congenital scurvy, especially of the latent
or rudimentary type.</p>

<p><b>Scurvy Has Been Induced Also in the Monkey.</b>&mdash;The most
extensive investigation of this kind is that of Hart and
Lessing, who brought about scurvy in several young Macaci
Rhesi which had been fed for some months on boiled
condensed milk with the addition of cooked rice and pig-nuts.
Typical scurvy resulted in all but one instance, and
in this case an old animal was used and a different pathological
picture developed. These experiments require
brief reviewing, as the clinical signs and gross pathology
in monkeys differ somewhat from those encountered in
guinea-pigs, and particularly as these distinctions render
scurvy in monkeys and in infants practically identical.</p>

<p>Apart from general listlessness and lack of activity,
the first sign is hemorrhage of the gums, the characteristic
sign of infantile scurvy. This is stated to be constant;
in the guinea-pig it is most exceptional. Another
sign characteristic of infantile scurvy is the subperiosteal
hemorrhage, which in the guinea-pig may be
found as a small effusion near one of the larger joints or
the costochondral junctions, but in the monkey consists
of large effusions, similar to those described by Barlow.
Subperiosteal hemorrhages of the cranial bones were
constantly seen, and not infrequently involvement of the
scapula and of the maxilla. Hemorrhage into the orbit
leading to exophthalmos and to hemorrhagic discoloration
of the upper lid&mdash;a lesion not infrequent in human scurvy&mdash;is
also described; in guinea-pigs we have met with
exophthalmos only in two instances. In all other respects
scurvy in the monkey resembles that in the guinea-pig,
even to the extent of the scorbutic rosary of the lower true<span class="pagenum" title="128"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>
ribs. Hart and Lessing describe the presence of the
&ldquo;white line&rdquo; of Fraenkel, which is referred to at length
in treating of the symptomatology of human scurvy. This
is a shadow, seen by means of the X-ray, traversing the
long bones near their epiphyses&mdash;a definite &ldquo;shadow
band&rdquo; associated with a narrow light zone lying just
beneath it. This &ldquo;white line&rdquo; has been noted likewise
by Talbot, Dodd and Peterson in the scurvy of monkeys.</p>

<p><b>Microscopic Pathology.</b>&mdash;Turning to the microscopic
pathology, we find that the changes are similar to those described
elsewhere in connection with human scurvy. It
will be unnecessary, therefore, to give more than a general
survey of the typical alterations. Little has been added to
the description of lesions so carefully depicted in the first
report of Holst and Froelich (1907). The bone marrow at
the ends of the diaphyses in proximity to the epiphyseal
junction loses its normal lymphoid character and is replaced
by a reticular or fibrillated substance, the so-called
&ldquo;framework&rdquo; marrow (Geruestmark of Schoedel and
Nauwerk) containing a homogeneous mucoid tissue and
only a few osteoblasts and marrow cells. The number of
blood-vessels is considerably reduced and fresh hemorrhage
or blood pigment is frequently seen. The osseous
tissue itself shows marked changes, corresponding to the
rarification and brittleness noted on gross examination.
The osseous trabeculæ are fewer in number and those
which remain are slender and irregular, and frequently
appear as isolated islets. The cortical substance also
becomes very thin. There are marked alterations in the
intermediate cartilages, especially of the ribs.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Instead<span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
of the cells being arranged in orderly rows, they are
irregularly placed, and frequently greatly reduced in size
and number. The bone trabeculæ on which they abut are
not well formed or of equal length, and do not present an
even and transverse plane, but are misshapen, small, so
that the line of junction with the cartilage is zigzag. In
cases of marked scurvy the junction may be entirely disorganized
and deformed, showing fractures of the rarefied
bone and hemorrhages in the neighborhood. This leads
frequently to a macroscopic deformity of bone, a bulging
of the surface at the costochondral junction&mdash;the scorbutic
&ldquo;beading&rdquo; or &ldquo;rosary&rdquo; of the ribs. Recently Delf and
Tozer have described these changes, classifying them as
those occurring in &ldquo;incipient,&rdquo; &ldquo;definite,&rdquo; &ldquo;acute,&rdquo;
&ldquo;chronic definite,&rdquo; and &ldquo;chronic acute&rdquo; scurvy. <a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a>
shows these types in diagrammatic form. In this figure
we see how varied may be the manifestations of this
nutritional disorder, according to whether it has existed
for a shorter or a longer time; in some instances the picture
is very puzzling. The &ldquo;incipient scurvy&rdquo; corresponds
to what we have termed clinically &ldquo;latent scurvy&rdquo;
in infants, a condition which cannot be diagnosed and is
manifested merely by a faulty nutrition which responds
promptly to the addition of an antiscorbutic to the diet.
There have been no histologic examinations in man at this
incipient stage, but we may infer that they are similar
to the bony changes found in the guinea-pig. When the
scurvy has become chronic in an animal which has lived
for months on a quota of antiscorbutic food sufficient to
preserve life but insufficient to prevent the development
of scurvy, we find a microscopic picture at the costochondral
junction differing widely from that seen in the acute
stage. Not only are the columns of cartilage cells represented<span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>
merely by misshapen vestiges, but an ossified band
(Fig. 9<sup><span class="fs65">5</span></sup>) is seen at the junction. It is probable that this is
frequently the cause of the marked cessation of growth
which has been described in connection with this type of
scurvy in infants. Delf and Tozer interpret this ossified
band at the junction as &ldquo;an attempt to strengthen the
junction in an abnormal manner, the normal process having
broken down.&rdquo; If the animal is again deprived of
antiscorbutic food the ossified band breaks down, the
junction becomes deformed and disorganized, and a
condition of &ldquo;chronic scurvy (acute)&rdquo; is stated to
have developed.</p>

but are more often noticeably shortened and usually somewhat disorganized or arranged in circular groups. The trabeculæ are usually about half
the normal length and have a truncated appearance. The junction as a whole may present an uneven, slightly disorganized appearance and there
is sometimes a certain amount of macroscopic deformity.</p>

<p>4. Diagram of rib-junction to illustrate &ldquo;Acute Scurvy.&rdquo; In these cases the junction and rows of cartilage cells are often completely disorganized,

contact with the edge of the junction and the space is filled with a mass of connective tissue; this is very characteristic in cases of fracture. A
condition in which the trabeculæ have almost disappeared and the rows are much shortened is also found in &ldquo;Acute Scurvy,&rdquo; in those ribs in
which no fracture of the shaft has occurred; usually, however, there is little or no ossification across the junction. There is frequently hemorrhage
into the marrow cavity.</p>

</p></div>

<p>It has been noted by many investigators that <i>changes
in the teeth</i> take place in the course of scurvy. They become
somewhat yellow and lose their glistening appearance,
and occasionally break off. The molars commonly
become loosened, so that they can readily be removed
from their alveolar sockets; less frequently this is true of
the incisors. Until recently, however, this subject has not
been studied in detail, and no significant histologic changes
in the teeth have been described. Jackson and Moore
showed that with marked changes in the teeth there was
often &ldquo;great dilatation of the veins in the pulp attended
by more or less hemorrhage into the pulp,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;in
guinea-pigs fed on oats and hay there was almost complete
necrosis of the pulp of the incisor teeth, also more or less
necrosis in the pulp of the molars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Recently an intensive study of this subject has been
made by Zilva and Wells, which is of special interest
because it describes the first beginnings of these lesions,
and particularly because we have no knowledge whatsoever
of the dental changes which occur in human scurvy. These
investigators found a fibroid degeneration of the pulp<span class="pagenum" title="131"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
of the teeth, a pulpar fibrosis. &ldquo;It is clear at once,&rdquo; they
write, &ldquo;and it is an important fact that no trace of cellular
organization, no trace of cell nuclei, no trace of interstitial
cement substances can be found anywhere. Nerves, cells,
blood-vessels, and odontoblasts have all shared the process
of fibrication and are no longer recognizable.&rdquo; These
radical changes in the teeth, brought about by a deficiency
of antiscorbutic vitamine, were demonstrated not only in
guinea-pigs but also in monkeys. In some instances they
were found where a histologic examination of the costochondral
junctions showed nothing abnormal. &ldquo;Profound
changes were recorded where the scorbutic changes during
life were so slight as to be almost unrecognizable,&rdquo; and,
they continue, &ldquo;the mildest degree of scurvy which could
just be discovered at the postmortem examination produced
well-defined changes in the structure of the teeth.&rdquo;
If this work is confirmed, we must consider the teeth as
one of the first tissues of the body to be affected by scurvy.
The authors quite rightly raise the question whether the
teeth of young children may not likewise be injured by a
deficiency of antiscorbutic vitamine, whether this may
not play a rôle in the dental caries so prevalent among
civilized communities. It is evident, they state, that such
transient conditions of infantile scurvy as have been described
by Hess as &ldquo;subacute&rdquo; or &ldquo;latent&rdquo; scurvy, may
occur more often than is usually suspected, and may reasonably
be expected to influence dentition. It seems quite
possible that the caries of the permanent teeth is due not
only to infantile rickets but also to infantile scurvy.</p>

<p>Besides the typical histologic changes in the bones
there are alterations in <i>other organs</i> which require mention.
All investigators have found a degeneration of the
muscles, showing a loss of their striations, swelling of the<span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>
fibres, and the presence of irregularly-distributed vacuoles
and granules. The interstitial tissue frequently is permeated
with edema, as we should expect from gross appearances.
Holst and Froelich have reported a fatty
degeneration of the heart muscle, as well as of the epithelium
of the mucous membrane of the glands of the stomach
and of the intestine. Hart and Lessing, in their protocols
of necropsies on monkeys, describe an interesting lesion
associated with the degenerated muscle fibres&mdash;a collection
of granules staining deep blue with hæmatoxylin and
dissolving on the addition of acid. These granules, interpreted
as being composed of calcium, were found in the
muscles of the limbs, of the tongue, and in the heart. It is
reasonable to attribute their formation to an absorption of
bone throughout the body. Similar calcium deposits were
seen frequently in the adrenal glands, in their cortex, or
at the border of the cortex and medulla. This lesion
gains special interest in view of the calcium deposits
described so frequently in connection with mercurial poisoning,
more particularly as the symptoms of scurvy and
of this toxic condition have marked clinical resemblances.</p>

<p>There has been but little histologic investigation of the
<i>nerves</i> in experimental scurvy. In fact, the only systematic
study of the kind is that of Holst and Froelich,
whose attention was drawn to this field in an attempt to
solve the relationship between scurvy and ship beriberi.
These writers found a true Wallerian polyneuritis in only
two pigs, one of which had been fed on wheat bread made
with yeast, and the other on decorticated barley. In many
instances, however, there was extensive degeneration of
the axis cylinders without degeneration of the sheaths.
They do not, however, attribute great importance to these
changes, as the same lesions were found in the nerves of<span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>
animals fed on cabbage and fresh potatoes. In view of the
confusing reports on the nerves of birds in experiments on
polyneuritis, one cannot be too careful in drawing conclusions
from histologic studies of this kind.</p>

<p>In the study by Jackson and Moore on experimental
scurvy in guinea-pigs, the histology of <i>the blood-vessels</i> is
carefully considered. &ldquo;Marked thinning of the wall&rdquo;
was found and depicted; &ldquo;the wall as a whole had partially
melted away, leaving few traces.&rdquo; These parts of the
wall contained many small round bodies resembling cocci,
which were stained a deep blue by the Wright and the
Giemsa methods. These bodies were present also in the
lumen of the vessel and in the inner layers of the more
normal portions of the wall. In addition to such changes
in the veins, &ldquo;lesions having the shape, location, and
characteristics of infarcts, were found in the ends of the
diaphyses of the long bones.&rdquo; As a result of this pathologic
picture the authors are of the opinion that they may
have been dealing with a mild infection. This is quite
possible, as scurvy tends to render the tissues less resistant
to the entrance of bacteria. We believe, however, that
even if such were the case, the phenomenon must be regarded
merely as secondary in its relation to the pathogenesis
of scurvy.</p>

<p>Following the study on the pathology of experimental
scurvy, Jackson and Moore undertook to determine primarily
whether the small stained bodies seen in the
sections of the scurvy lesions were bacteria. This investigation
has been cited frequently as presenting cogent
evidence in favor of the <i>infectious nature of scurvy</i>, so
that it will be necessary to consider it fully; the general
question of whether scurvy is a bacterial infection is discussed
under the consideration of etiology.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span></p>
<p>As is well known, Morpurgo, a generation ago, claimed
to have produced rhachitic lesions in young rats by means
of artificial infection with a gram-positive diplococcus.
Pappenheimer brought about similar lesions in rats by
the injection of a suspension of bone marrow from a rhachitic
animal. Koch injected a streptococcus longus intravenously
into young dogs, occasioning gross bony changes
of the epiphyses and costochondral junctions, and
microscopic changes resembling scurvy&mdash;an irregular line
of ossification and &ldquo;a framework&rdquo; marrow, which, however,
showed regions of osteoid. Jackson and Moody
were able to isolate from the crushed tissue of their
guinea-pigs &ldquo;a diplococcus of low virulence with a tendency
to form chains and produce green (color) on blood
agar.&rdquo; Pure strains of these organisms inoculated into
the circulation of guinea-pigs and rabbits, living under
ordinary conditions (a mixed diet consisting of green
vegetables, hay and oats), gave rise in most instances to
hemorrhagic and other lesions in the bones, joints, muscles,
lymph-glands or gums. Hemorrhages were found
beneath the periosteum in the region of the lower incisor
teeth and the acetabulum and ribs. These results are
far from constituting evidence in favor of the microbic
origin of scurvy. They show merely that the tissues of
scorbutic animals frequently harbor bacteria, and that
injections of these bacteria will bring about hemorrhages
which may be subperiosteal in character. They are open
to the specific criticism that scurvy was produced readily
in the rabbit, an animal which otherwise does not develop
scurvy, and, furthermore, they differ from feeding experiments
in inciting scurvy notwithstanding the fact that
the animals were receiving an antiscorbutic diet (green
vegetables). Cultures of the hearts&rsquo; blood of the affected<span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>
animals were sterile in every instance; a result obtained
likewise by Holst and Froelich.</p>

<p>Further studies of this kind should be carried out and
should include cultures of the blood and tissues of guinea-pigs
in the various stages of scurvy, especially the early
stage. In addition, a histologic study should be made
of the bones of animals injected with bacteria (preferably
streptococci), in order to ascertain whether notwithstanding
an unrestricted diet, typical lesions can be produced
by this means.</p>

<p>For further details of the pathology of scurvy, the
reader is referred to the chapter on human pathology.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;Let us consider the symptomatology of
guinea-pig scurvy. In the course of an observation of
many hundreds of animals we have been struck by the
striking uniformity of the signs and symptoms. The animals
made use of were almost invariably of moderate size,
weighing from 200 to 300 grams. Where heavier pigs
were employed the disease progressed less rapidly, but
the signs were the same; they were, however, more difficult
to elicit, owing to the subcutaneous fat. Most of the
animals were on a diet of hay, oats and water <i>ad libitum</i>,
but there was no variation in symptoms where fat and
fat-soluble vitamine were supplied by an addition of egg
yolk or of cod liver oil, or where egg albumen was fed to
render the protein adequate, or where the inorganic salts
were supplemented by additions of sodium or calcium
chloride.</p>

<p>There is a variability in the sign which signalizes the
onset of the disorder&mdash;sometimes it consists of a flattening
of the weight curve, at others of an inordinate excitability
of the animal, or frequently of a tender joint, generally a
wrist. The joints almost invariably become tender early<span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
in the disease, causing the animal to wince and cry when it
is examined. Accompanying this tenderness there is often
slight swelling due to edema, or perhaps some hemorrhage,
which alters the sharp, clean-cut contour of the
joint. This edema may extend upward along the tendon
sheaths. Soon the animal becomes lethargic rather than
nervously active, and may look ill, as manifested by a
roughness of its coat and its unnatural posture. Frequently
it sits on three legs with the tender hind leg
drawn upward and outward so as to escape pressure&mdash;a
posture termed by Chick, Hume and Skelton (1918, 2) &ldquo;<i>the
scurvy position</i>,&rdquo; and indicative of hemorrhage into the
joints or muscles. At times it lies curled up, with the side
of its face resting on the floor, as if to support its painful
or sensitive jaw; this they have termed the &ldquo;<i>face-ache
position</i>.&rdquo; The two diagnostic signs, however, are the
hemorrhages about the joints and the loosening of the
teeth. The diagnosis frequently can be established by
the twelfth to the fourteenth day; the earliest diagnosis
was made on the eighth day. Hemorrhages appear somewhat
later than tenderness, and are situated at the joints,
most frequently at the knee, which may be markedly
swollen and show a bluish or reddish discoloration, extending
upward or downward for some distance. Other
joints are often involved, frequently the wrist, the ankle
or the shoulder. In other cases hemorrhages into the
muscles are noted, especially of the leg or of the thigh,
and later, especially toward the end, hemorrhages from
the bowel. Fractures or separations of the epiphyses may
be found on examination or may be occasioned by the
physical examination. A frequent site of this lesion is at
the wrist or at the knee, involving the head of the tibia<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
or the lower end of the femur. These fractures knit
rapidly when an antiscorbutic is given, but result at times
in deformity.</p>

<p><i>Loosening of the teeth</i> is another typical sign. It is,
however, one which does not appear early and is somewhat
difficult to elicit. The molar teeth are generally involved,
especially those of the upper jaw, which may be so completely
separated from their alveolar sockets that they
can readily be removed by forceps. It is, however, impossible
to examine the molar teeth satisfactorily during
life. Far less frequently an incisor tooth becomes loosened;
more often it loses its glistening appearance and
looks dull and yellowish. Occasionally an incisor tooth
fractures. The gums are rarely altered sufficiently to aid
diagnosis; not infrequently they are congested or bluish,
rarely hemorrhagic, and never ulcerous or spongy. This
is the chief difference between the symptomatology of
scurvy in the guinea-pig and in man, and probably is the
result of lesser susceptibility of the former to infection
by pyogenic bacteria. In general, however, the disorder in
the guinea-pig bears a closer analogy to infantile than to
adult scurvy; due to the fact, possibly, that young pigs
are generally used for the experiments.</p>

<p>A sign of great interest, although not of diagnostic importance,
is the <i>&ldquo;beading&rdquo; of the ribs</i> noted by many
observers, and emphasized by Jackson and Moore. It has
been described also in monkeys by Hart and Lessing.
This is an enlargement or swelling of the costochondral
junctions of the ribs, especially of the lower true ribs.
It corresponds clinically to the &ldquo;beading&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;rosary&rdquo; so characteristic of infantile rickets and mistakenly
termed the &ldquo;rhachitic rosary.&rdquo; As pointed out,
in discussing the symptomatology and pathology of human<span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
scurvy, this sign must be regarded as truly scorbutic in
animals as well as in infants. The &ldquo;rosary&rdquo; is difficult
to palpate in pigs which have considerable subcutaneous
tissue; in thin animals, however, its course can be followed,
the gradual development and subsequent disappearance.
In this connection the enlargement of the epiphyses
must be mentioned, another sign supposed to be characteristic
of rickets in infants. Marked swelling of the wrists
is frequently encountered in guinea-pigs suffering from
scurvy&mdash;a bony enlargement involving the lower epiphyses
of the ulna and of the radius. This is met with far more
commonly in chronic scurvy than in the usual acute case.
Where the disorder has existed for a long period, these
bony knobs may persist indefinitely, constituting the sole
residual sign of a former scorbutic condition.</p>

<p>The relation of <i>loss of weight</i> to the development of
the scurvy requires consideration. In experiments carried
out on rats to test the diets in respect to the water-soluble
and the fat-soluble vitamines, the weight curve is
used as the main criterion to judge whether the foodstuff
is adequate. In guinea-pigs we cannot employ the weight
curve as a criterion. Not infrequently an animal develops
scurvy, and nevertheless does not lose in weight, but even
gains slowly and steadily. This occurs when the appetite
remains good, and the dietary is complete except for antiscorbutic
vitamine. The same holds true for human
scurvy, as we have noted in connection with the symptomatology.
We have attempted to make up for this defect by
adding to the charts a curve representing the clinical
course (Fig. 10). Although this curve is computed on an
empirical basis, it gives a comparatively true picture of
the disease and is far more exact than attempting to<span class="pagenum" title="139"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>
portray the disease by means of a weight curve.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Indeed,
when we rely on the latter method it is impossible frequently
to illustrate graphically the reaction of guinea-pigs
to various influences. Another disadvantage of the
weight curve is that it is influenced by factors having no
direct relation to scurvy, especially infections of various
types which retard the gain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/fig_010.png" width="380" height="215" alt="Loss of weight in guinea-pig scurvy " />
<a id="Fig_10"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;Hay, oats, and water <i>ad libitum</i> during period I
resulted in a lack of gain in weight, and in a development of
scurvy. During period II, 1.5 c.c. of orange juice were given
daily, and as will be seen there was a marked gain in weight
and disappearance of the scorbutic signs, although, as is generally
the case, they continue to develop for a short while after
an antiscorbutic is given. When the orange juice was discontinued
in the third period, the weight once more fell and the
scurvy redeveloped. The broken line represents the course of
the scurvy, and is a composite formed on the basis of the
aggregate of the scorbutic signs. Each square represents a
2-day interval.
</div>

<p>Guinea-pigs generally die of scurvy after having lost
about one-third of their body weight; occasionally the loss
is greater, reaching almost 50 per cent. This loss is due
partly to the scorbutic condition, but to a greater extent
to starvation occasioned by a marked lack of appetite. In
this connection it may be noted that guinea-pigs frequently<span class="pagenum" title="140"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>
lose for a few days following the addition of an
antiscorbutic to the dietary (Fig. 11). This reaction is
evident from a perusal of the weight charts of other investigators,
and occurs likewise in human scurvy. This
loss is accompanied, as Gerstenberger has pointed out, by
diuresis, which may be so marked that it is evident to the
casual observation of those caring for the animals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/fig_011.png" width="380" height="447" alt="Dried milk as an antiscorbutic " />
<a id="Fig_11"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;These guinea-pigs developed scurvy in spite of
receiving a large quantity of the water in which young
carrots had been cooked for only 20 minutes. It will be
noted, however, that although the pigs developed scurvy
they did not lose weight, as is usually the case. After they
had developed definite scurvy they were given in addition
the equivalent of 80 c.c. of a dried milk prepared by being
heated to about 116° C. for a few seconds. The addition
of this milk to the diet cured the scurvy, showing that it
had largely retained its antiscorbutic vitamine.
</div>

<p>Exophthalmos may be mentioned again in this connection
as a very rare sign of guinea-pig scurvy. Hæmaturia<span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>
also occurs at times; it is not known how frequently
it is present, whether it is an early manifestation in the
guinea-pig as in the infant, or whether the source of the
blood is the kidney or the bladder.</p>

<p>The superficial lymphatic glands are frequently palpable
in scurvy, especially those in the inguinal region.
This sign is emphasized by some pathologists. It has
seemed to us attributable less to the nutritional condition
than to the infections which so frequently complicate
the disorder.</p>

<p>According to Jackson and Moore a rise of temperature
does not accompany scurvy in the guinea-pig. As the
result of an examination of nine guinea-pigs they conclude
that &ldquo;experimental scurvy is a non-febrile disease
in the majority of affected animals.&rdquo; Nor did they find a
leucocytosis, the average leucocyte count of eight scorbutic
pigs being about 8000.</p>

<p>As the data are meagre, a consideration of the chemical
alterations associated with the scurvy of guinea-pigs and
monkeys will be taken up in conjunction with the metabolism
of human scurvy. The therapy of animal scurvy
will also be deferred (<a href="#Page_143">chapter VI</a>), as the reaction to
dietetic measures is practically the same in man and in
animals. In concluding this chapter we would call attention
to the following interesting statement contained in the
recent paper by Delf and Tozer: &ldquo;In other experiments,
however, where a liberal supply of an antiscorbutic was
given and where the fat-soluble A growth factor was
known to be deficient, the resulting histological changes in
the rib-junctions of the animals examined were found to
resemble closely those of &lsquo;Definite&rsquo; or of &lsquo;Definite
Chronic&rsquo; scurvy. In these test cases the antiscorbutic
chosen was, we believed, deficient in the fat-soluble A<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
growth factor (for example, orange juice). This fact
is mentioned because in the case of an animal not receiving
an adequate supply of fat-soluble A the resulting
changes in the junctions are not dissimilar from, and are
likely to be confused with, those caused by scurvy alone.&rdquo;
If this observation is confirmed, it emphasizes the necessity
in nutritional experiments, of constructing a dietary
which is complete in every respect except the one under
investigation; it also suggests the development of new
pathologic entities in relation to other nutritional disorders
resulting from a lack of the accessory food factors.</p>

<h2><span class="fs85">CHAPTER VI</span><br />
ANTISCORBUTIC FOODS</h2>


<p><b>Historical Review.</b><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>&mdash;It is impossible to state when and
how the knowledge of the value of antiscorbutic foodstuffs
came to be appreciated. It is probable that the potency
of herbs and fruits in scurvy was known empirically to
individuals and groups of people long before the fact
gained general recognition. A most interesting history of
antiscorbutics is given in the excellent work of Hirsch and
in our great classic on scurvy by Lind. The first realization
of the value of lemons and oranges seems to have
been the result of a chance discovery. Budd tells us that
in the sixteenth century sailors of a Dutch sailing vessel
laden with these fruits were attacked with scurvy, and
that, when they partook of the lemons and oranges in the
cargo, a miraculous cure resulted. He narrates also the
following striking incident, which is mentioned likewise
by Lind:</p>

<p>In the year 1600 four sailing vessels left England
for the East Indies. The sailors on three of these ships
did not receive lime juice, whereas those on the fourth
received their daily quota. The men of the first three
ships suffered severely from scurvy, but those on the
fourth escaped.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span></p>
<p>In an excellent work on &ldquo;Scorvey,&rdquo; published in 1685,
Harvey wrote: &ldquo;Wherefore most acids, especially spirit of
salt marine, juice of sorrel, limons, citrons, etc., are so
deservedly extolled in some scorbutic distempers and
seconded with good success.&rdquo; Thus we see that even at
this early date it was taken for granted that citrous fruits
possessed virtue in curing scurvy. Bachstrom (Observationes
circa Scorbutum, 1734) evidently was well-acquainted
with the antiscorbutic value of scurvy grass,
and relates the story of a sailor severely disabled from
scurvy who was put ashore to perish on Greenland, and
crawled on the ground, grazed on scurvy grass like a beast
of the field, and was able to return home perfectly recovered.
(Cited from Lind.)</p>

<p>The credit for forcing a general acceptance of the
antiscorbutic value of fresh food belongs to Lind. He
did not, however, have an easy task, and in 1747, in order
to convince those who still were skeptical, he resorted to
an experiment on human beings. Twelve patients in his
hospital were given the same diet, except that some received
sea-water in addition to their dietary, others vinegar,
or elixir of sulphuric acid, or a daily portion of cider,
or oranges and one lemon daily. The last two groups,
as we should expect, recovered quickly; one man who
received cider improved, but in no other case was any
alleviation noted.</p>

<p>Lind extols the value of lemons and oranges, of berries,
of sour cabbage, of cider, and of all fresh fruits and
vegetables. In spite of the fact, however, that Lind&rsquo;s
teaching was based on an experience with thousands of
patients suffering from scurvy in the naval hospital, his
ideas did not take root. It required an event which came
directly under the official eye to bring about radical<span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>
changes in the diet of the sailors. In 1795 the English
Fleet suffered from a severe epidemic of scurvy, which
was finally controlled by giving the sailors fresh vegetables
and fruit. This therapeutic result was so convincing
that thenceforth a daily ration of lime juice was
ordered for the sailors and a regular issue provided for
the navy. This marks the cessation of scurvy as a scourge
of the British navy. From this time the disease appeared
only sporadically. The sharp decrease in the incidence
can be appreciated by Budd&rsquo;s statement that 1457 cases
of scurvy were admitted to the Royal Naval Hospital in
1780, whereas in 1810 an English physician reported that
in the seven preceding years he had not treated a single
patient in this hospital suffering from scurvy. In another
marine hospital, between the years 1806 and 1810,
only two cases of scurvy were admitted.</p>

<p>Nothing was done for the British merchant service
until over half a century later, although scurvy continued
to make its appearance among the sailors with varying
severity. Smith states in the article on this subject
in Allbutt&rsquo;s System of Medicine: &ldquo;In 1864 it was
pointed out by Doctor Barnes that during the twelve
years following 1851, 1058 cases of scurvy had been admitted
into the hospital ship <i>Dreadnought</i>.&rdquo; In 1854 a
law was passed requiring every vessel to carry an adequate
supply of lime juice. This law, however, failed in
effect, due to the fact that a large part of the lime juice
was adulterated. A new shipping-act was passed, therefore,
in 1867, with the object of preventing adulterations,
at the same time increasing the daily quota for each seaman
from half an ounce to one ounce.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to add a few words concerning
certain antiscorbutics which have been under discussion<span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>
or recognized for so many years that they have acquired
an historical aspect. One of these foodstuffs is sauerkraut,
which was recognized by Lind in 1772 as having
particular potency in this disease. It is interesting to note,
in this connection, that this writer appreciated the close
relationship of acidity to antiscorbutic virtue. &ldquo;One
quality,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;entering the most perfect antiscorbutic
composition is a vegetable accescency.&rdquo;  He prized
sauerkraut for its inherent value, and particularly, because
he found that &ldquo;sour cabbage will keep for an East-India
voyage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The famous navigator Cook, whose voyages were remarkable
for the freedom from illness which his sailors
enjoyed and the absence of scurvy, always kept a large
supply of sauerkraut on hand. It was believed by many
that the immunity of the Dutch seamen to scurvy was due
to their large consumption of this vegetable. As the
result of this empirical knowledge, the English navy
in 1780 introduced the use of sauerkraut into its ration.
As just noted, however, this antiscorbutic was supplanted
some few years later by an issue of lime juice.</p>

<p>It is common knowledge that outbreaks of scurvy
follow closely upon a failure of the potato crop. This has
been particularly the case in Ireland, where it was especially
evident in relation to the great epidemic of scurvy
in 1847. Holst and Froelich inform us that &ldquo;all scurvy
epidemics in Norway in the nineteenth and beginning of
this century followed failure of the potato crop.&rdquo; Nor
is this danger past. In an article entitled &ldquo;The Rôle of
Antiscorbutics in Our Dietary,&rdquo; the author recently reported
that the partial failure of the potato crop in the
eastern part of the United States led to the development
of scurvy in numerous institutions, in one of which over<span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>
200 cases of definite scurvy developed in the spring (1916).</p>

<p>The occurrence of scurvy in the navy and on sailing
vessels has been associated in the minds of many with the
large amounts of salted meat which necessarily was included
in the dietary. It was evident that meat that was
salted had no antiscorbutic value, but the query has been
raised whether eating a considerable amount of salted
meat did not induce scurvy. Lind mentions &ldquo;flesh long
salted&rdquo; as leading to the development of scurvy. The
question of the value of meat as an antiscorbutic is of
importance at the present time, chiefly in connection with
Polar expeditions and army rations. As the result of an
outbreak of scurvy in the Polar expedition of 1875&ndash;6,
a British Arctic Survey Committee was appointed to
make an investigation. In 1877 it reported that &ldquo;although
the scurvy was due to the absence of lime juice
from the sledge dietaries, meat in large amounts is able
to prevent the disease.&rdquo; Stefánsson also emphasized the
value of meat in preventing scurvy in the Polar regions.
In his expeditions he has found that raw meat, if taken
in sufficient quantity, is able to afford complete protection.
Jackson, who lived for some years among the Samoyeds,
tells us that this tribe, owing to the fact that they consumed
considerable reindeer meat, never suffered from
scurvy in spite of the fact that they ate no vegetables or
fresh fruit during the winter.</p>

<p>The following account, a personal communication
from Dr. Harrison J. Hunt, who spent four years in
the Arctic regions, is of interest in this connection:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For some four years I was with the Smith Sound
Eskimos, on the northwest coast of Greenland. These
people get nothing but animal food normally, and have
lived that way for many generations, yet are healthy, of<span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>
good physique, and are normal in other ways. Scurvy
was unknown to them as far as I could ascertain; certainly
there was none while I was among them. Much
of their meat is eaten raw, and the rest only partly cooked;
that is, &lsquo;rare done.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whalers who were accustomed to winter in Hudson
Bay practically always had scurvy in the crew. It was
common knowledge among the captains that fresh meat
was curative of scurvy, and it was their practice to obtain
meat from the Eskimos whenever possible for that purpose.
The last English expeditions to the South Polar
regions were afflicted with scurvy which was entirely and
quickly eradicated by the use of fresh seal meat in the
place of salt meats and canned foods. They do not state
that this meat was eaten raw or even rare cooked. On
the Danish coast of Greenland, during seasons poor in
game, scurvy is quite common, but the natives there live
largely on breadstuffs (very coarse rye bread). Personally,
during my four years in the Arctic, I took no fresh
vegetables whatever, or other commonly-called antiscorbutics,
relying solely on rare or raw meat. I never was
stronger or more healthy in my life. I did have dried
fruits and vegetables, and usually plenty of fresh bread.
Usually the Eskimos eat their raw meat in a frozen condition,
and I can attest that it is extremely palatable in
that condition.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do not wish to discuss, in this place, the value of
meat as an antiscorbutic; in passing, however, it may be
said that, as in the case of the other antiscorbutics, its efficacy
will depend largely upon the amount consumed. The
British Mesopotamia Commission Report of 1917 shows
that scurvy can develop on a ration which includes 28
ounces of meat a week. We must remember, however, that<span class="pagenum" title="149"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span>
this refers to cooked meat, whereas in the Polar expeditions
meat generally was eaten in a raw state.</p>

<p>Recently an historical inquiry has appeared in an
article by Chick, Hume and Skelton as to the antiscorbutic
virtue of limes and lemons. This sketch is of exceptional
interest because it treats of the oldest and most cherished
antiscorbutics, and particularly because it has unearthed
a peculiar fallacy in their connection. As they state, there
would appear to be every reason for believing &ldquo;that the
use of so-called lime juice was responsible for the disappearance
of scurvy from the British navy in the first
decade of the nineteenth century.&rdquo; It would seem, however,
that the lime juice which gained this great reputation
in the navy some 125 years ago was in reality lemon
juice, and that it was not until about 50 years ago that
lime juice was really used. These authors show&mdash;by one
of those striking human experiments which, occasionally,
is available&mdash;that in a Polar exploration which was organized
in 1850 lemon juice was issued to each man, and that
no case of scurvy developed, whereas in a similar expedition
which went out in 1875 lime juice was issued and
scurvy developed the following spring with great severity
among the sledge crews. This investigation, therefore,
seems to prove that lime juice, the prototype of antiscorbutics,
has been accorded a false position; that in reality
the sailors of the past have been protected by lemon juice.</p>

<p><b>Antiscorbutic Foods.</b>&mdash;As far as has been ascertained,
the antiscorbutic food factor exists in all fresh vegetable
and animal tissues, being present to a far greater degree
in the former than in the latter. It is distinguished by
being associated in nature with cells which are the seat of
active metabolism, just as the water-soluble vitamine is
associated mainly with cells which are in an inactive<span class="pagenum" title="150"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>
or dormant state. Vegetables or fruits may be mildly or
highly antiscorbutic; there is indeed a remarkable difference
in their content of antiscorbutic factor or vitamine.
They vary widely also in the degree to which their potency
is affected by physical or chemical conditions. In this
chapter the most common animal and vegetable antiscorbutic
foodstuffs will be considered and the effect which
processes such as drying, canning, change of reaction, etc.,
exert on their specific value. Their therapeutic application
in the prevention and cure of scurvy will be considered
in a subsequent chapter. Until recently our knowledge
of this subject was empirical and inaccurate; as the
result of scientific work, however, carried out during the
past few years in different parts of the world, quantitative
and comparative figures of antiscorbutic food values have
been evolved.</p>

<p><b>Milk.</b>&mdash;It is important to have as accurate an idea as
possible of the value of milk as an antiscorbutic, as the
infant depends on it during the first months of its life for
a supply of this essential factor. Considerable attention
has been paid to this question in the last few years, and
recent reports tend to confirm the former estimations
which had been overlooked and forgotten. In 1847 Curran
wrote that in the Irish epidemic of this year they had
admitted to the Dublin Union Hospital 80 cases of scurvy
which had been on a diet which included one pint of milk
daily, but was deficient in vegetables. From this experience
he realized that milk was not rich in the principles
which protect against scurvy. In the following year
Parkes came to the same conclusion, stating that 500 to
750 c.c. of raw milk did not always suffice to prevent
scurvy. In addition to these opinions concerning adults,
similar conclusions have been drawn from clinical experience<span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span>
with infants. Barlow (1894) realized that a small
amount of milk was insufficient to protect against scurvy.
Still writes: &ldquo;The antiscorbutic power of fresh, unboiled
milk is evidently slight.&rdquo; In 1914 Hess and Fish pointed
out that &ldquo;milk must not be considered as having potent
antiscorbutic properties.&rdquo; Nevertheless, when this question
was raised recently by the experimental work of
Jackson and Moore, and that of McCollum and Pitz, it
was not appreciated that, like other antiscorbutics, milk
must be regarded from a quantitative standpoint, and
that, as it is a weak antiscorbutic, its effect must depend
largely on the quantity consumed.</p>

<p>The first laboratory work on this subject was that of
Froelich in 1912, who showed that guinea-pigs could be
protected by an exclusive diet of fresh milk, and that raw
milk is more effective than heated milk. In his work, the
amount of milk taken by the animals was not measured, so
that it is impossible to glean from it more than these general
conclusions. In the following year, as a result of some
quantitative experiments, Funk stated that he was able
to protect guinea-pigs with 50 c.c. of fresh milk in addition
to an oat diet. This estimate, as subsequent workers
showed, is too low. Chick, Hume and Skelton were the
first, however, to investigate the antiscorbutic potency of
milk in a systematic and convincing manner. They
demonstrated that if the daily consumption of fresh milk
was less than 50 c.c., a guinea-pig died almost as quickly
as if it received no milk; if the daily quota varied from
50 to 100 c.c., a greater or less protection from scurvy
was observed, varying proportionately with the amount
consumed; if 100 to 150 c.c. were taken daily, which practically
amounts to a complete milk diet, satisfactory growth
and development occurred, and no symptoms of scurvy<span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>
were observed. This represents in a general way the
present conception of the antiscorbutic power of milk.
In passing, it may be remarked that it is not altogether
clear why 50 c.c. of milk do not afford partial protection,
and prolong the life of the animal for a definite length
of time. The authors conclude that &ldquo;milk is evidently
a food poor in the antiscurvy accessory factor, and a
ration large in comparison with that of other antiscorbutic
materials is necessary to afford satisfactory protection
from scurvy.&rdquo; The error must be avoided, however,
of regarding milk as a standard article of diet containing
a definite and specific amount of vitamine per
cubic centimetre. It will be shown later that this point
of view cannot be taken in regard to vegetables, and it is
probable that it cannot be assumed for milk.</p>

<p>A general conception of the antiscorbutic potency of
cow&rsquo;s milk may be gleaned from the fact that it requires
a minimum of about sixteen ounces (500 c.c.) daily to
protect an infant from scurvy or to cure it. Twelve
ounces have failed to effect a cure in several instances,
although the milk was raw and of the best grade. If
it is pasteurized, a larger quantity is required, depending
upon various conditions connected with the heating
process and upon the age of the milk, circumstances
fully discussed in relation to etiology. Thus it becomes
evident that pasteurized milk assumes a two-fold rôle, acting
as an antiscorbutic if little of its vitamine content
has been destroyed and if a large quantity is consumed,
or leading to the development of scurvy when one or
both of these conditions is unfavorable. The same
holds true for milk which has been boiled for a short
period. If the milk has been heated twice, it tends to<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>
produce scurvy; if it is condensed, the greater part of its
antiscorbutic value is destroyed.</p>

<p>It seems necessary to emphasize again the important
fact that <i>dried milk</i> may possess marked antiscorbutic
potency, depending on the method of preparation (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig.
11</a>). As stated, sixteen ounces of milk dried by the Just-Hatmaker
process cured scurvy promptly, in spite of the
fact that the milk had been dried six months previously.
Here, therefore, is a food of high caloric value, compact,
antiscorbutic, and stable. The fact that milk, in spite of
drying, retains this labile vitamine for so long a period,
demonstrates that it is available in the most remote parts
of the world, and that the possibilities of its transportation
are unlimited.</p>

<p>Little is known regarding the antiscorbutic content of
the milk of the various domestic animals. Some claim
that goat&rsquo;s milk is notably rich in this particular, but
experiments with it are too few to warrant conclusions.
Lind writes: &ldquo;Goats, of all animals, afford the richest
whey, possessed of the greatest antiscorbutic virtue&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; which
in a singular manner restores the constitution when
weakened and impaired by scurvy.&rdquo; Human milk possesses
about the same potency as cow&rsquo;s milk, as mentioned
in the discussion of the occurrence of infantile
scurvy in countries where the adult form is endemic.
Twelve ounces of human milk, from a woman on a liberal
and varied diet, barely sufficed to alleviate the symptoms
of a case of moderate intensity.</p>

<h3>FRUIT JUICES</h3>

<p><b>Orange and Lemon Juice.</b>&mdash;The most thoroughly studied
antiscorbutic foods are orange and lemon juice, which
have been singled out because they contain the antiscorbutic<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
factor in the highest concentration. It has
been ascertained through the work of various investigators
that guinea-pigs require about 3 c.c. daily of either
of these juices to protect them from scurvy, but that
about half this amount is sufficient to prevent the manifestation
of clinical signs.</p>

<p>Both of these juices withstand heat remarkably well.
Orange juice can be boiled for 10 minutes without noting
any diminution of its antiscorbutic value, and lemon juice
heated to 110° C. without appreciably losing its efficacy.
However, orange juice undergoes some change as the
result of being heated in an autoclave for 45 minutes at a
temperature of 110° under 10 to 15 pounds pressure.
Although 6 c.c. of this heated preparation were able to
prevent the development of scurvy, the guinea-pigs did
not gain nearly as well as those which received 3 c.c. of
the unheated juice. It seemed as if there was a destruction
of some factor apart from the antiscorbutic principle.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that these juices withstand heat
well, they are sensitive to some other conditions. Orange
juice which had been stored in the cold for three months
was unable to protect guinea-pigs in the dosage of 3 c.c.
per animal, resembling in its action the autoclaved juice.
When this orange juice was six months old, double this
quantity failed to protect; throughout this period it was
kept in the ice-box and covered with a layer of oleum
petrolatum to avoid the access of air or possible contamination.
Harden and Zilva met with a similar experience,
and state that &ldquo;after storing treated (concentrated) lemon
juice for about a fortnight in a cold room, a marked loss
can be observed in its potency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These authors reported also that when orange juice is
<i>rendered slightly alkaline</i> it loses its antiscorbutic potency.<span class="pagenum" title="155"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>
This question was investigated in relation to
canned tomato juice, as well as to orange juice, and it was
found that shortly after having been rendered 0.05 N
alkaline to phenolphthalein, neither of these foods had
lost an appreciable amount of its antiscorbutic factor.
Five cubic centimetres per capita daily of freshly-alkalized
orange juice were able to cure a group of pigs which
had developed scurvy on another diet. If, however, 24
hours were allowed to elapse instead of only one-half
to one hour, between the alkalization and the feeding, then
a considerable amount of the antiscorbutic factor was lost.
The same general rule seems to hold for alkalization as
for heating, <i>i.e.</i>, the length of time the antiscorbutic food
is subjected to the deleterious influence is fully as important
as the intensity of the process. Advantage has
been taken of the fact that freshly-alkalized orange juice
retains its potency, in using it intravenously in the treatment
of infantile scurvy.</p>

<p><i>Subcutaneous injections</i> of neutralized orange juice
failed to cure scurvy in guinea-pigs; Harden and Zilva
were equally unsuccessful with large doses of their concentrated
lemon juice. This is of interest in view of the
marked therapeutic result which Shiga obtained with subcutaneous
injections of the water-soluble vitamine in
pigeons suffering from polyneuritis. It should be added
that Holst and Froelich (1912) failed to cure scurvy
in guinea-pigs by intraperitoneal inoculations of
orange juice.</p>

<p><i>Lemon juice or orange juice may be dried</i> and lose
little of its antiscorbutic power. In their paper of 1912
Holst and Froelich reported the efficacy of lemon juice
evaporated in a vacuum, and recently Harden and Zilva
published experiments which proved that &ldquo;by evaporating<span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
the treated lemon juice to dryness in an acid medium
an active dry residue is obtained.&rdquo; Still more recently
Givens has shown that orange juice reduced to a powdered
form by means of a spraying process has lost little
of the antiscorbutic factor. These results prove that
under certain conditions the antiscorbutic factor withstands
drying; one of these favorable influences is an acid
reaction, and another, rapidity of desiccation.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p><b>Lime Juice.</b>&mdash;Recently an investigation of lime juice
has been carried out by Chick, Hume and Skelton. They
were &ldquo;unable to detect any significant protection in a
daily ration of from 5 to 10 c.c.<ins title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: redundant &rdquo; deleted"> </ins>of preserved lime juice
which was several months or a year or more old.&rdquo;
Crude lime juice of various ages had slight antiscorbutic
value, affording only partial protection in a daily ration
of 5 c.c. Even fresh juice was found not to be very efficacious
compared with lemon juice. The authors conclude
that &ldquo;the relative value of these two fruit juices deduced
from the trials with monkeys is therefore in accord with
that obtained in the experiments with guinea-pigs, <i>i.e.</i>, the
value of fresh lemon juice is approximately four times
that of fresh lime juice.&rdquo; Holst and Froelich in 1907
carried out a similar but less extensive investigation.
They also found that lime juice was unable to protect
guinea-pigs from scurvy. Fuerst, a co-worker of Holst,
continued this work, and in his article of 1912 stated that
guinea-pigs should not be protected by a daily addition to
their ration of 25 g. of lime juice; these guinea-pigs received
a mixed diet consisting of dry vegetables, butter,
almonds and malt extract. These two reports of the Norwegian<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
investigators on this interesting subject should
have attracted attention.</p>

<p><b>Other Fruits.</b>&mdash;A word may be said in regard to some
other fruits. The antiscorbutic potency of <i>raspberries</i>
was tested by Holst and Froelich (1912) and found comparable
to oranges and to lemons. The juice was also<span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>
highly resistant to heat, so that 10 c.c. of freshly-pressed
juice were of protective value, even after it had been subjected
to 100 or 110° C. for one hour. Guinea-pigs which
were thus treated showed no microscopic signs of scurvy
in any of the ribs, in the tibiæ or the femora.</p>

<p>These authors also reported that they found <i>banana</i>
and <i>apple</i> poor in antiscorbutic power, 30 g. daily being
insufficient to protect a guinea-pig (Table 3). This was
our experience with banana in the treatment of infants
suffering from mild scurvy. The banana has been shown
by Sugiura and Benedict to be poor also in the water-soluble
vitamine. It would be of interest to determine
the difference in vitamine content between the fully ripe
and the unripe fruit.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that <i>grapes</i> are used considerably
in the treatment of infantile scurvy, it is of importance
to realize that they are poor in the antiscorbutic principle.
Chick and Rhodes found that three of four guinea-pigs
receiving 20 g. daily developed scurvy; they rated the
potency as ten times less than that of orange juice.</p>

<h3>VEGETABLES</h3>

<p>It is everyday knowledge that fresh vegetables
are of great value in the protection from, and cure of,
scurvy. The first experimental investigation of this
subject was that of Holst and Froelich, published in
1907, and continued in a series of papers extending to
1916. These investigators tested the potency of a large
number of vegetables by feeding them in varying quantities
to guinea-pigs. They found that all vegetables have
antiscorbutic value but to a markedly varying degree.
Cabbage, sorrel leaves, endive, head salad, and dandelion
leaves, were found to be of most avail in protecting against<span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
scurvy, whereas carrots, cooked potatoes and cooked turnips,
and cauliflower proved to be of less value. In general,
it may be stated that the leafy vegetables have more
antiscorbutic power than the roots or the tubers. This
generalization, we shall see, is not without exception, <i>e.g.</i>,
the swede. Similar experimental work has been recently
carried on by a group of investigators at the Lister Institute,
who have added considerably to our knowledge
in this field. In all this experimental work cabbage has
been found to be the most potent of the vegetables, and
therefore experiments have centered about it just as in
considering fruits the work has centered about orange
juice or lemon juice. We shall, therefore, discuss in detail
its reaction to heat and dehydration.</p>

<p><b>Cabbage.</b>&mdash;Holst and Froelich found that 1 g. daily
of fresh cabbage afforded nearly complete protection to
guinea-pigs, and Delf has corroborated this work. This
amount is sufficient to prevent the development of manifest
scurvy, although it does not induce satisfactory
growth. In this respect it is comparable to giving 1.5 c.c.
of orange juice daily. If guinea-pigs take only 0.5 g. of
raw cabbage, scurvy will develop; whereas 2 g. or more
will promote satisfactory growth and no scorbutic changes
will be found on microscopic examination.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Heating.</b>&mdash;Vegetables are of decidedly less
antiscorbutic value when cooked than raw; cabbage, for
instance, on being boiled is weakened about one-half.
Heating to 110° C. for an hour destroys almost all of its
antiscorbutic factor. Delf&rsquo;s tests did not show so great
a loss. She came to the conclusion, of theoretical and
practical value, that slow cooking at a low temperature
is much more deleterious than rapid cooking at a higher
temperature. Hess and Unger found that carrots lost<span class="pagenum" title="160"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>
much of their antiscorbutic power after boiling, and that
this was the result of a true destruction, the vitamine not
having been merely dissolved in the water of boiling; for
if guinea-pigs consumed 40 c.c. per capita of this water,
they were not protected against scurvy (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>). Acidulating
the water with 10 per cent. vinegar did not reduce
the loss, an experience similar to that of others using
citric acid or lemon juice.</p>

<p><i>Vegetables cannot be considered from an antiscorbutic
standpoint as a standard and uniform foodstuff, as they
vary in their content of this factor according to their
freshness and age.</i> This was demonstrated by means of
feeding experiments with carrots. For example, 35 g. of
old carrots, such as were used for feeding the laboratory
animals, afforded but little protection after having been
cooked in an open vessel for about 45 minutes, whereas the
same amount of young carrots cooked this way protected
the guinea-pigs. It is obvious that this distinction is of
importance in evaluating the antiscorbutic content of the
various foods, and in considering whether individuals and
groups of individuals are receiving an adequate quota
of antiscorbutic vitamine. It will be noted later that it
is also of importance in connection with the potency of
dehydrated vegetables. Recent experiments indicate that
not only age, but the <i>degree of ripeness</i> must be considered
in appraising the food value of vegetables. Feeding
experiments showed that tomatoes which were fully
ripe were more potent than those which were slightly
green. Probably many other factors play a rôle in determining
the richness of vegetables in vitamine. It may
not be immaterial whether they are allowed to ripen on
the vine or shrub, or mature subsequently. The nature
of the soil may also affect the antiscorbutic quality of<span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>
the vegetables or fruit. So that it is evident that we must
not be schematic in considering this question, and must
realize that a table of antiscorbutic values, such as accompanies
this text (<a href="#TABLE_3">Table 3</a>), does not furnish definite and
inflexible values.</p>

<p>There is a marked difference between <i>vegetables and
vegetable juices</i> in keeping quality, and in their reaction
to heat and to acid. In general, it may be stated that
the juices are much more sensitive. Holst and Froelich
brought out this point in 1912 and enlarged upon it in
their publication of 1916. The different juices vary
greatly in this respect; for example, dandelion juice is
acutely sensitive to heat, whereas sorrel leaves withstand
high temperatures very well. In regard to these differences
an analogy may be drawn to the fruit juices.
Lemon, orange and raspberry juices are markedly
thermostable, but lime juice is weakened markedly by
heat. Many of these juices are protected by the addition
of acid&mdash;5 per cent. of lemon juice increasing the thermostability
of cabbage juice&mdash;whereas, as we have stated,
little is gained by cooking vegetables in an acid medium.</p>

<p><b>Potato.</b>&mdash;The civilized world is dependent for its quota
of antiscorbutic foodstuff largely upon the potato. It
might be thought, therefore, that this would signify that
the potato is endowed with great antiscorbutic power.
Such is not the case, however, as demonstrated both by
laboratory tests and clinical experience. Considering its
importance, there have been surprisingly few feeding experiments
carried out with potato. Holst and Froelich
(1912) found that 17 g. of potatoes, steamed at 100° C.
for 30 minutes, afforded but slight protection, and that it
required 20 g. to fully protect a guinea-pig. Givens and
Cohen failed to ward off scurvy by means of cooked potatoes<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
fed to the equivalent of 5 g. of the raw vegetable
(guinea-pigs will not eat raw potatoes). There are no
accurate figures as to the quantity of potatoes needed to
protect a human being from scurvy. The statement of
Doctor Guy, however, who after careful study of convicts&rsquo;
diets, concluded that 14 ounces daily would protect them
from scurvy (if the ration included one ounce of other
fresh vegetable and 4 ounces of meat), is probably close
to the mark.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> With the experience that potatoes play
such a significant rôle in the prevention of scurvy, how
are we to interpret the fact that they are only mildly antiscorbutic?
Potatoes are consumed in very large amounts;
in the Temperate Zone probably twice as many pounds
of potatoes are consumed during the winter as of all other
vegetables combined (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). It is evident, therefore,
that in a practical evaluation of antiscorbutic foodstuffs,
not only the intrinsic antiscorbutic potency must be considered,
but also the quantity of the vegetable or
fruit consumed.</p>

<p><b>Swede.</b>&mdash;We cannot leave the consideration of vegetable
antiscorbutics without adding a few words as to the
value of swede juice,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> which has been recently highly
recommended by Chick and Rhodes, who found it comparable
to the cabbage and the onion, and even to orange
juice. For example, 25 c.c. of raw swede juice were equivalent
to 1.5 g. of raw cabbage. It is, therefore, more
potent than the juice of raw carrot, and far more efficacious
than the juice of the beetroot (<a href="#TABLE_3">Table 3</a>). Tests
carried out with this antiscorbutic in infant feeding<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
seemed to show that it is of value in this field. The
authors believe that the potency of vegetables is closely
associated with certain botanical species, and that in this
way the marked virtue of the swede can be explained, as
it belongs to the natural order of Cruciferæ, which includes
also the cabbage, the scurvy grass and the cresses.
If, however, this is a rule of nature, it is difficult to explain
the marked difference between the lime and the
lemon, which are both varieties of Citrus Medica.</p>

<p><b>Dehydrated Vegetables.</b>&mdash;For hundreds of years fresh
vegetables have been dried to serve as food during the
winter months and have fulfilled a useful purpose on
account of their small bulk and great food value. The
question for us to consider, however, is whether dehydrated
vegetables still retain their antiscorbutic quality
and can be counted on to supply this factor in the dietary.
At present this subject is engaging the attention of laboratory
workers as well as of practical dietitians and food
hygienists. The experience of the past is not happy in
this regard. In the Medical and Surgical History of
the War of the Rebellion we read as follows: &ldquo;A scorbutic
tendency was developed at most of our military posts during
the winter season, after the troops had been confined
to the use of the ordinary ration with desiccated vegetables.
The latter in quantities failed to repress the disease.&rdquo;
In spite of this and similar military experiences<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
the employment of dehydrated vegetables was urged recently
for rationing our soldiers, the claim being made
that &ldquo;by simply soaking in water and boiling in the<span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>
same water these vegetables are brought back to the condition
of fresh vegetables.&rdquo; Both in this country and in
England there was strong propaganda during the war to
dehydrate vegetables on an enormous scale and to substitute
them for the fresh food.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_012.png" width="400" height="331" alt="Dehydrated vegetables as a cause of scurvy " />
<a id="Fig_12"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;Hay, oats, water <i>ad libitum</i>, and 7 g. of dehydrated
carrots dried at a room temperature of about 130° F.
about 1 month previously. All animals developed scurvy.
The marked gain in weight when an equivalent amount of
fresh carrots was substituted for the dehydrated vegetable
corresponded to the disappearance of scorbutic signs.
Guinea-Pig B 951 did not receive fresh carrots, as it was
evidently ailing at the time the second period began.
</div>

<p>Experimental investigation on this subject may be
summarized as showing that vegetables dried according
to present methods lose their antiscorbutic value as the
result of dehydrating (Fig. 12), and that they become
still more impoverished as the result of aging. We
should not sweepingly condemn the principle of dehydration,
as very possibly some slight modifications in the
process may be devised which will counteract the deteriorating
influence. In their paper of 1912, to which
reference has been made so often, Holst and Froelich<span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>
reported that potatoes, carrots, peas, lentils and almonds
have practically no protective value after they are thoroughly
dried. In two reports&mdash;one giving the results of
feeding various brands of dehydrated carrots to guinea-pigs,
and the other of an attempt to cure scurvy in babies
by means of these carrots&mdash;we also came to the conclusion
that the antiscorbutic factor had been almost completely
destroyed. Givens and Cohen (1918) found that even
cabbage dried at a low temperature retained only a small
amount of its potency after a month, and Delf and Skelton
came to practically the same conclusion, also noting that
the cabbage on being kept, steadily lost what little of the
antiscorbutic factor had survived the drying process. The
same was true of the fat-soluble factor. These authors
made an observation which may prove of value in helping
to solve this problem, namely, that &ldquo;the residual amount
is distinctly greater if the cabbage is plunged into boiling
water before drying.&rdquo; This protective action of heat
they suggest may indicate that: &ldquo;Some at least of the
destruction may be due to the activity of an enzyme or
other body originally present in the living tissue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another observation which may prove of practical
value in rendering dehydrated vegetables the nutritional
equivalent of the fresh vegetable is that when the carrots
selected for dehydration are young and fresh a product
is obtained which possesses decided antiscorbutic power.
In this connection the following statement by Falk and his
co-workers in a study of the enzyme action of vegetables
and the effect of dehydration is significant: &ldquo;In considering
these enzyme results, it may be pointed out that the
state of ripeness and the age of the vegetable undoubtedly
influence the activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The most promising dehydration experiment has been<span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>
conducted by Holst and Froelich and was published in
1916 in a paper which has passed unnoticed. They dried
white cabbage so that it retained its antiscorbutic properties,
and, to a large extent, its color and taste, for a period
of two years. This result was accomplished by keeping
out all moisture and preventing hydrolysis,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> a method
which is employed in preserving antitoxins, toxins and
agglutinins. It is by far the most encouraging test reported,
and should be made the basis of further work by
those actively interested in perfecting dehydration.</p>

<a id="Fig_13"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;Cure of scurvy by the addition of canned tomato. In this case, as frequently,
the alleviation of symptoms preceded the gain in weight.
</div>

<p><b>Canned Food (Tomatoes).</b>&mdash;In the course of canning, as
in dehydrating, most vegetables and fruits lose their antiscorbutic
properties. A general denunciation, however,
of all canned foods is incorrect, as there are exceptions
to this rule. It has been shown by Hess and Unger that<span class="pagenum" title="167"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
canned tomatoes possess a high degree of antiscorbutic
power (Fig. 13), and it is probable that most of the
acid fruits and vegetables are able to withstand the canning
process. It was found, in an experiment embracing
many series of guinea-pigs, that 4 c.c. daily of strained,
canned tomato are sufficient to afford protection, even
when a lot was used which had been prepared a year previously.
This is indeed remarkable, considering that the
food undergoes a two-fold heating in the course of canning,
during one of which (&ldquo;processing&rdquo;) the temperature
is raised to fully 230° F. Tomatoes have another advantage
over most other vegetables in that they are richly
endowed with the water-soluble vitamine, as shown by our
tests on pigeons suffering from polyneuritis, and by the
experiments on rats of Osborne and Mendel, who found
tomatoes far superior in this respect to turnips, onions,
beetroots or beans. They are also rich in the fat-soluble
vitamine. In view of the availability of canned tomatoes
and their excellent keeping quality they are well suited to
an extended use as an antiscorbutic. In the subsequent
chapter we shall discuss their employment in infant feeding
and in the army ration.</p>

<p><b>Germinated Cereals and Pulses.</b>&mdash;In 1912 Fuerst reported
that although the resting seed&mdash;the cereal grain, the pea,
bean and lentil&mdash;are poor in antiscorbutic vitamine, they
develop this principle as soon as they germinate. They
possess, in other words, latent antiscorbutic properties,
and are potentially antiscorbutic. This observation is not
only of scientific interest but of practical value, as these
pulses are well suited for transport and do not readily
deteriorate. For this reason, Chick and her co-workers
at the Lister Institute, who were searching for an antiscorbutic<span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>
foodstuff for the army, directed their attention
to the utilization of the pulses. In the course of a thorough
investigation (1919) they found that although it required
30 to 40 g. daily of dry green peas to prevent
scurvy in the guinea-pig, a consumption of 10 g. of the
germinated peas afforded satisfactory protection.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> The
soaked seeds have an antiscorbutic value comparable to
many of the fresh vegetables; by no means as great as
cabbage, but somewhat greater than that of carrots. As
the result of cooking, their potency was found to be reduced
about 75 per cent. We shall have occasion to refer
to this antiscorbutic food in the chapter on treatment in
connection with the rationing of armies.</p>

<p><b>Meat and Eggs.</b>&mdash;As has been stated, animal tissues are
distinctly inferior to fruits and vegetables in the antiscorbutic
principle. As there has been no accurate evaluation
of these foods&mdash;the only test being one by Chick,
Hume and Skelton, where 10 c.c. <ins title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: originally or">of</ins> raw beef juice failed
to protect guinea-pigs&mdash;we have to depend upon clinical
experience for our knowledge. Beef juice is highly rated
by physicians in the prevention of infantile scurvy, but
it is probably far less potent than vegetables or fruit
juices. The Arctic explorers, and many who have lived in
the Arctic regions, agree that the inhabitants are protected
from scurvy during the winter months by their diet of
fresh meat and fish. The Admiralty Enquiry on the outbreak
of scurvy in the Arctic Expedition of 1875 reported
that a large ration of meat is necessary to afford protection.
Curran (1847) described three cases admitted to
the hospital in the great Irish epidemic of that year, where<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
the diet previously had included three-quarters of a pound
of meat on five days of the week. From these and similar
experiences the conclusion is manifest that the divergence
of opinion regarding the value of meat is based upon quantitative
differences in the rations. Evidently, if sufficient
meat is provided, the development of scurvy will be obviated.
Another factor which must be borne in mind is
that those who refer to meat in the Arctic regions refer to
fresh raw meat, which is a far more valuable antiscorbutic
than the ordinary cooked meat.</p>

<p>There is almost no experimental data on the antiscorbutic
value of <i>eggs</i>. Hard-boiled eggs were fed to guinea-pigs
and it was found that 9 g. per capita daily was
insufficient to protect them. An attempt was also made
to cure infantile scurvy with a daily addition of one raw
egg to the dietary, but without avail. It is possible that
fresh raw eggs have an antiscorbutic value comparable to
meat, but the large quantity required makes dependence
upon them impracticable.</p>

<p><b>Beer and Alcoholic Beverages.</b>&mdash;For generations beer has
been highly regarded as an antiscorbutic. Captain Cook
prized it greatly and always supplied his men with a
freshly-made infusion of malt called &ldquo;sweetwort.&rdquo; Lind
writes: &ldquo;Beer and fermented liquors of any sort will be
found the best antiscorbutic remedies&rdquo; (<a href="#Page_76">p. 76</a>). He refers
at different times to the value of spruce beer, ale, wine
and other vinous liquors. In his excellent book on &ldquo;Military
Hygiene,&rdquo; Munson writes: &ldquo;Good beer and wine
have decided value, also vinegar.&rdquo; On the other hand,
recent scientific experiment has shown that beer has practically
no antiscorbutic value. There is but one study on
this subject, that of Harden and Zilva, which is quite convincing.<span class="pagenum" title="170"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>
They found that guinea-pigs and monkeys developed
scurvy in spite of the fact that they received,
respectively, 50 c.c. and 180 c.c. of beer daily. They conclude,
as a result of their experiments, that &ldquo;bottled ale
and stout and fined beer as brought on to the market, are
lacking both in antineuritic and antiscorbutic accessory
factors, and that kilned material is also wanting in these
two principles.&rdquo; The apparent contradiction between
practical experience and laboratory investigation in regard
to beer is due to a difference in the process of brewing.
Cook and Lind and the older authors refer to freshly-made
beer, whereas the modern beer which was tested in
the laboratory was made from &ldquo;high-dried&rdquo; material.
The antiscorbutic potency of beer as formerly used was
due to its preparation from freshly-germinated grain and
its consumption shortly after brewing. Dyke tells us of
an interesting incident illustrating the importance of this
distinction. In the recent war an outbreak of scurvy
occurred among the Kaffir labor battalion in France. At
home these natives consume a large amount, as much as
three gallons a day, of Kaffir beer, which is made from
freshly-germinated corn, and is consumed shortly after
it is made. The French prepared a similar fermented
beverage for their South African laborers, the sole difference
in preparation being that the process of germination
had been omitted for reasons of convenience. Scurvy
resulted, a disorder which is practically unknown among
the natives at home.</p>

<p><b>Miscellaneous Foodstuffs.</b>&mdash;During the past few years a
great many different kinds of foods have been tested
in the laboratory for their antiscorbutic value. It will
be well for completeness&rsquo; sake to say a word about them,<span class="pagenum" title="171"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>
although they have been found to possess little or no
antiscorbutic properties. The studies of Holst and
Froelich showed definitely that all the cereals&mdash;oat, barley,
rye, maize, and preparations made from the bran
or from the endosperm&mdash;are devoid of antiscorbutic vitamine.
Cohen and Mendel added 3 per cent. of calcium
lactate or sodium chloride, or 5 per cent. of butter, without
enhancing the value of oats in this respect.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/fig_014.png" width="450" height="300" alt="Failure of yeast as prophylactic " />
<a id="Fig_14"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;Failure of yeast as a prophylactic; latent scurvy promptly yielding to orange juice.
</div>

<p>As is well known, yeast possesses the water-soluble
vitamine in marked concentration. It is natural, therefore,
that its antiscorbutic power was put to the test,
especially as it has been accorded therapeutic value. Hess
and Unger showed that autolyzed yeast was of no value
in the cure of infantile scurvy (Fig. 14); Chick and Hume
(1917) and Cohen and Mendel (1918) came to the same<span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>
conclusion in regard to guinea-pig scurvy, making use of
autolyzed yeast, yeast extract and dried brewers&rsquo; yeast.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that cod liver oil is practically a
specific for human rickets, Hess and Unger tried the effect
of this oil both in infantile scurvy and in that of guinea-pigs.
It proved to have no protective or curative value.
The animal experiments were confirmed by Cohen and
Mendel. The use of olive oil also proved futile.</p>

<p>Pitz in 1918 reported that in animal experiments he
had found that lactose was able to protect against scurvy,
and attributed this result to its power to alter the intestinal
flora. We shall not enter into a detailed discussion
of this question, as the study was carried out on a ration
embodying unlimited and uncontrolled amounts of milk,
and it has since been shown that the apparent cure was
due to an increased consumption of milk by the animals
in the progress of the experiment. Cohen and Mendel,
Harden and Zilva, Hart, Steenbock and Smith (1919) all
failed to protect or to cure their animals with lactose
when they were placed on a ration which was definitely
measured and limited. Hess and Unger failed to cure
infantile scurvy by means of lactose.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that scurvy is due to a lack of
secretion of the endocrine glands, a question which will
be referred to again in considering the relation of scurvy
to other &ldquo;deficiency diseases.&rdquo; With this idea Ingier
added thyroid, hypophysis, thymus and parathyroid to
the food of guinea-pigs, or gave it parenterally. She was
unable to observe any beneficial results. Jackson and
Moore met with the same result on feeding desiccated thyroid
gland. We may add that we gave dried thyroid
and also parathyroid glands in the treatment of infantile
scurvy without effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span></p>
<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>

<p>Any consideration of the question of antiscorbutic
foodstuffs brings into sharp relief the difference between
empiricism and scientific investigation. For well
over a hundred years it was generally known that
scurvy could be cured by fruits or vegetables, and yet no
further progress was made toward a more complete
understanding of the value of these foodstuffs. As far
back as 1847 Budd ascribed the action of antiscorbutic
foods &ldquo;to an essential element, which, it is hardly too
sanguine to state, will be discovered by organic chemistry
or the experiments of physiologists in a not far distant
future.&rdquo; Busk, in giving his testimony in 1877 before
the British Scurvy Commission, said that it was his belief
&ldquo;that scurvy was due to the fact that the diet was
lacking in a peculiar and as yet little-understood factor.&rdquo;
The question remained in this hypothetical and inactive
state until it was attacked recently by experimental
methods. Decided advance has been made only in the past
few years, since these foodstuffs have been studied from
a quantitative viewpoint.</p>

<p>The antiscorbutic factor is abundant in fresh foods,
especially in vegetables and fruits, and to a considerably
less extent in animal foods, such as milk, meat and fish.
Among the vegetables there is a marked distinction in
potency. A beginning has been made in standardizing
these various foodstuffs, in grading them approximately
according to their antiscorbutic efficacy (<a href="#TABLE_3">Table 3</a>). It
should be remembered, however, that the importance of an
antiscorbutic food depends not only on its intrinsic content
of the antiscorbutic factor, but quite as much on the
amount of the food which is eaten. For example, although
potatoes possess only moderate virtue compared with<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>
orange juice, they are of greater practical value in view of
the large quantities which are consumed and their availability
when green vegetables are lacking. Furthermore,
the fact recently brought out that the various vegetables,
and perhaps the fruits as well, have considerably more
value when they are fresh and young than when they are
old, warns us not to carry our quantitative standardization
too far.</p>

<p>Fruits and vegetables which are dehydrated have been
found to have lost their antiscorbutic properties. This
generalization is not without its exception, for it has been
found that cabbage and tomato withstand drying well,
and that if milk is dried under favorable conditions it
retains a very large part of its antiscorbutic value. It
may be stated that the outlook is bright in regard to
dehydration, as the problem has not yet been thoroughly
studied, and the process may be so improved that there
will be little difference in the nutritional value between the
fresh and the dehydrated food.</p>

<p>The study of antiscorbutic values points a lesson in
regard to the methods of cooking vegetables. It has
demonstrated that short cooking, associated with a high
degree of temperature, is less deleterious than longer
cooking at a low degree. In other words, that less damage
is brought about by boiling or by steaming vegetables
than by stewing them. Here age and freshness again
play a rôle; in fact, a double rôle, as the older and tougher
vegetables contain not only less antiscorbutic, but require
more prolonged cooking.</p>

<p>In general, the belief is correct that canning destroys
the antiscorbutic value of foods, but once more an exception
must be made, for it has been found that acid foods,<span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>
such as the tomato, withstand the canning process with
but little loss of potency.</p>

<p>The field of antiscorbutic foodstuffs is one which is
fertile for future investigation. The antiscorbutic status
of milk heated to various heights of temperature and subjected
to various degrees of aging furnishes problems
of great practical importance. A lack of growth has
been noted when antiscorbutics are given which have been
subjected to a high degree of heat (<i>e.g.</i>, autoclaved orange
juice). Whether this is due to the destruction of some
other growth factor is a question which has been raised
by several experimental studies and requires an answer.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that we shall find useful antiscorbutic
foods which at present are unknown or unappreciated.
The recent introduction of the swede, of the canned
tomato and of germinated pulses suggests and even renders
this probable. On the other hand, the recognition of
the comparative poverty of the antiscorbutic factor in
lime juice shows the importance of putting each foodstuff
to the experimental test.</p>

<h2><span class="fs85">CHAPTER VII</span><br />
SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS</h2>


<p>The identity of scurvy in the infant, in the young child
and in the adult is thoroughly established and requires
no further substantiation. There are, however, sufficient
differences between the symptoms of adult scurvy and
those of Barlow&rsquo;s disease to render it advisable to consider
them separately. These distinctions are due largely
to the fact that the former disorder affects mature tissues,
whereas the latter is engrafted upon tissues which are
in the process of rapid growth and development. The
symptomatology is influenced also by the striking differences
in environment&mdash;the passive, shielded existence of
the infant, contrasted with the active and exposed life of
the adult. Although we shall, therefore, treat adult and
infantile scurvy separately, it should be borne in mind
that, from an etiologic and pathologic viewpoint, such a
division is artificial and is resorted to merely for purposes
of clarity.</p>

<p><b>Adult Scurvy.</b>&mdash;The earliest sign of scurvy is usually
a change in the complexion of the individual. His color
becomes sallow or muddy, an aspect difficult to describe,
but one which is characteristic, and constitutes an important
danger signal to the eye of the experienced physician.
About the same time the patient loses his accustomed
vigor, seemingly becomes indolent and complains
of tiring quickly, and of breathlessness. He may experience
fleeting pains in the joints and limbs, especially
in the legs, symptoms which are frequently attributed to
rheumatism. At this early stage the appetite may still<span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>
be normal, there is usually no loss in weight, but merely
a general malaise which is significant, although in no way
distinctive. Very soon the gums become sore, bleed readily,
and are found to be congested, spongy, and somewhat
hemorrhagic at their edges. Absolute reliance must not,
however, be placed on this sign for early diagnosis, as
at times it does not appear until later. Careful examination
at this stage will disclose petechial spots on the body,
more especially on the legs, at the site of the hair follicles,
or even larger ecchymoses, depending upon the hemorrhagic
tendency of the individual, his exposure to bruising,
the adequacy of his diet, and secondary infection.
Less frequently bleeding from the nose occurs early, or
the eyelid suddenly becomes swollen and purple, or the
urine shows the presence of blood.</p>

<p>These signs progress steadily with a varying degree
of rapidity. The complexion becomes more dingy and
somewhat brownish, the weakness increases so that the
slightest exertion causes breathlessness and palpitation,
and the gums become spongy and even fungous. If there
is infection of the gums and the teeth are carious, the
breath is extremely foul&mdash;a sign long associated with
scurvy. Later the teeth become loose and may fall out,
and the alveolar process undergoes necrosis. The surface
hemorrhages increase in severity, large effusions appearing
on the trunk, on the extremities, and less often beneath
the mucous membrane of the mouth. A bloody
diarrh&oelig;a may take the place of the constipation which is
generally noted earlier in the disease. There are at this
time hemorrhages into the muscles and deeper tissues,
especially into the calves of the legs, giving rise to hard,
brawny, tender swellings which have been termed &ldquo;scurvy
sclerosis.&rdquo; This is sometimes the earliest sign noted by<span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>
the patient and may puzzle the physician who has not
met with it before. The swelling may be found in the
popliteal space or at the site of the tendo Achilles, and
result in lameness and contracture of the neighboring
joint. Frequently there is slight edema of the ankles
associated with a glossiness of the extensor surfaces of
the legs. This infiltration differs from ordinary edema
in being firm and not pitting on pressure. The skin is
dry and rough, the follicles being unusually elevated;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
the hair likewise is dry and loses its lustre. Not infrequently
subperiosteal hemorrhages occur, giving rise to
exquisitely tender swellings, especially of the tibia or
of the femur, or of the ramus of the lower jaw, as has
been noted in connection with guinea-pig scurvy. If there
are wounds or ulcers they assume a hemorrhagic aspect,
the edges becoming bluish or livid and showing no tendency
to heal; even scars which have existed for many
years change in color and show an altered state of nutrition,
and ulcers long healed break out afresh.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the disease usually does not reach this
stage, and rarely progresses further. If, however, the
patient remains untreated, he becomes progressively
weaker and more lethargic; there is frequent palpitation,
shortness of breath, and increasing loss of weight. The
pains in the limbs render him helpless and an object of
pity. Marked edema may be added to the picture as the
result of starvation, so that the legs become swollen,
and even the face becomes bloated. Hemorrhages into the<span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>
skin as large as the palm of the hand appear on different
parts of the body. The gums swell to such an extent that
they overlap and may even hide the teeth and protrude
from the mouth as foul fungoid growth. Death comes
about in various ways. Frequently sudden and fatal
syncope occurs, due to heart weakness or to the pouring
out of fluid into the pleural or the pericardial cavities.
Another frequent cause of death is secondary infection,
resulting in pneumonia, which finally ends the suffering of
the patient. The fatal outcome is thus described in the
narrative of Lord Anson&rsquo;s voyage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Many of our people, though confined to their hammocks,
ate and drank heartily, were cheerful, and talked
with much seeming vigor, and in a loud, strong tone of
voice; and yet, on their being the least moved, though it
was only from one part of the ship to another, and that
in their hammocks, they have immediately expired; and
others, who have confided in their seeming strength, and
have resolved to get out of their hammocks, have died
before they could well reach the deck. And it was no
uncommon thing for those who could do some kind of duty,
and walk the deck, to drop down dead in an instant, on any
endeavor to act with their utmost vigor; many of our
people having perished in this manner during the course
of this voyage.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The disease may develop and progress in various
ways. It may remain latent for a long period and be
cured by some accidental change of diet, or, as more frequently
occurs, it runs a moderately acute course, and is
promptly cured by means of antiscorbutics. In the days
when scurvy was common and widespread it sometimes
became chronic, developing into the &ldquo;inveterate scurvy&rdquo;<span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>
of the older authors, which was notably resistant to treatment.
Harvey, in his treatise published in 1685, states
that &ldquo;a mild scurvy may continue or be protracted to ten,
twenty, or thirty years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition to the general picture of the disease which
we have presented, mention should be made of other less
common symptoms. As is well known, one of the characteristic
signs of scurvy is <i>hemorrhage</i>. Indeed, in many
of the systematic treatises of medicine it is classified as
a hemorrhagic disease. Besides the bleeding into the
gums, skin and bones, hemorrhage into the stomach may
take place, giving rise to hæmatemesis, or there may be
hemorrhage into the eye, under the conjunctiva or into
the anterior chamber, leading to the destruction of the
eyeball. A very unusual form is meningeal bleeding,
giving rise to symptoms of apoplexy. It may be stated
in general that hemorrhage dominates the picture of
scurvy. Eruptions which in normal individuals are simply
macular or papular, assume a hemorrhagic character
when occurring in a scorbutic individual. This phenomenon
was noted in the recent war in connection with the
eruption of typhus fever, and has been observed by military
and naval surgeons in numerous expeditions.</p>

<p>Scurvy reduces the nutritional state of probably all
the cells and tissues of the body. If the resistance is
still further lowered by exposure, nutritional disturbances
will result more readily than where the tissues are
normal and well nourished. For this reason we believe
that scurvy may predispose to <i>frostbite</i>. Reports of congelations
occurring in the trenches in the course of the
World War tend to confirm our opinion that scurvy was
a predisposing factor in many of these cases. This has
been true in other wars. For example, Munson writes<span class="pagenum" title="181"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span>
that &ldquo;during the Crimean War the temperature was never
very low and a report of the times suggests that the large
number of congelations observed among the soldiers
might well be regarded as gangrene owing to a scorbutic
tendency exaggerated by the cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In connection with the involvement of the gums, another
typical symptom of scurvy, it should be remembered
that this sign may appear late and therefore fail to
be of value for early diagnosis, and that it occurs also
in purpura and thus may lead to error. This is especially
the case if there is pyorrh&oelig;a. As is well known, hemorrhages
of the gums appear only where teeth are present,
and are absent in the edentulous gums of old people as
well as in babies who have no teeth. Immerman is probably
correct in believing that an injury is always necessary
to produce a hemorrhagic lesion in scurvy, and that
this explains the early involvement of the gums and also
their non-implication in the absence of teeth.</p>

<p>It is a common belief that separation of the epiphyses
occurs only in infants and young children, and not in
the scurvy of adults. This, however, is not correct, as in
severe adult scurvy there is frequently a separation of the
epiphyses of the long bones of the lower extremities or
of the ribs, the latter resulting in a sinking of the sternum.</p>

<p>The pulse is sometimes slow and feeble, having been
recorded as low as 40 beats per minute, but more frequently
is rapid, in the neighborhood of 140. It is, however,
almost invariably unduly excited by emotion or by
mild physical activity. Frequently there is a low type of
fever, which has been termed &ldquo;scorbutic fever,&rdquo; but
which probably should be regarded as a complication of
the disease rather than as an intrinsic symptom.</p>

<p>There is little tendency to the formation of pus. Although<span class="pagenum" title="182"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>
the lymphatic glands are frequently enlarged and
effusions into the tissues and into cavities of the body
are by no means uncommon, they show little tendency to
become purulent. In the severe cases described by the
older authors, the breaking down of the glands in the inguinal
region&mdash;buboes&mdash;is frequently noted. The urine is
apt to be scanty, becoming much more profuse following
treatment. Perspiration is also retarded.</p>

<p>A peculiar symptom reported in connection with
numerous epidemics of scurvy, both on sea and on land, is
<i>nyctalopia or night-blindness</i>. The patients can see fairly
well during the day, but have very little vision as soon as
darkness develops. This phenomenon has puzzled many
observers, as nothing abnormal has been found on examination
of the eyes. Recently O&rsquo;Shea, who met with many
cases of this nature among soldiers, has reported that in
an ophthalmic examination of 22 cases the only abnormality
was pallor of the optic disc in 3 cases. This
weakness of sight is due to the general nutritional weakness
and has been reported in connection with other exhausting
and nutritional diseases&mdash;for example, hunger
edema. More rarely there is day-blindness.</p>

<p>As a complication, dysentery may be mentioned. This
has been described by Schreiber and others in scurvy epidemics
occurring in the course of the World War. Jaundice
may appear, and might be expected to occur more
often in view of the marked congestion of the upper duodenum
found so frequently at necropsy.</p>

<p>Pericarditis, hydrothorax, pleurisy with effusion,
pneumonia, are common complications of severe forms of
scurvy. Lind reports that the dominant complication
varies in different epidemics; that on one cruise many<span class="pagenum" title="183"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>
cases of diarrh&oelig;a would occur and on another many pulmonary
infections.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Shea reports the exceptional case of a man who was
operated upon for acute appendicitis. A large hemorrhage
in the wall of the cæcum was found, as well as some
other hemorrhages in the peritoneal cavity. This report
is interesting, not so much from a diagnostic standpoint
as because &ldquo;contrary to what might have been expected,
scorbutic cases when operated upon showed no particular
tendency to hemorrhage.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Infantile Scurvy.</b>&mdash;The stereotyped picture of infantile
scurvy and the one which this term commonly suggests,
is that of the acute form of the disease. In <i>acute infantile
scurvy</i> we have to do generally with a poorly-nourished,
pale infant with a peculiarly alert and worried
expression. As we approach its bed it whimpers or cries
out in terror. Frequently its posture is characteristic, as
it lies quietly on its back with one thigh everted and flexed
on the abdomen. Examination shows that one or even
both thighs are swollen and exquisitely tender, or that
there is merely tenderness, the baby shrieking at the
slightest pressure upon the lower end of the femur. If
teeth are present, the adjacent gums are red, swollen and
bleed readily. This is the syndrome which the medical
student is taught to carry away to guide him in his everyday
practice. It is the acute, florid type, and presents a
striking picture, but must not be regarded as the common
form of the disorder. If we are to diagnose infantile
scurvy early and not overlook its more subtle manifestations,
the classic textbook description must be augmented
by portrayals of types of the disorder which are
less crude and more difficult to recognize&mdash;of &ldquo;subacute&rdquo;
and of &ldquo;latent&rdquo; scurvy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span></p>
<p>The commoner form, which we have termed &ldquo;<i>subacute
infantile scurvy</i>,&rdquo; comprises a large number of symptoms
which are inconclusive individually, and frequently escape
correct interpretation. The affected baby is usually in the
second half of the first year of life, and does not gain in
weight or gains but slightly for weeks. It may be fairly
well nourished, but is pale or sallow, with perhaps slight
edema of the upper eyelids. The mother or nurse complains
that the child is irritable and peevish, and that the
appetite is poor or capricious. The gums show a lividity
or slight peridental hemorrhage, which on subsequent
examination may be no longer visible, and may have consisted
merely of a rim of crimson edging the borders of
the upper gum, perhaps behind an upper incisor, as Still
pointed out. On closer examination it may be observed
that the papillæ of the tip of the tongue are markedly congested,
and that a petechial spot is to be seen on its frenum,
on the palpebral conjunctiva, or here and there on the
surface of the body, more especially where there are erosions,
eczema or other skin lesions. Attention may be
called to tenderness of the lower thighs, which in some
instances is definite, in others so ill-defined and fleeting
that it is impossible to convince oneself of its significance
or even reality. There may be slight edema over the
crests of the tibia, of a kind which does not pit on pressure.
The knee-jerks are almost always markedly exaggerated.
The urine is diminished in volume but is generally normal
or contains a trace of albumen and red and white blood-cells.
The pulse is frequently rapid, and becomes markedly
rapid and irregular on the slightest excitement. The
respirations are also rapid (<a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>).</p>

<p>These symptoms do not constitute a rigid entity, but
are subject to manifold variations. The syndrome may<span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>
be rendered less typical and clear by the fact that the
infant has gained steadily rather than lost in weight, as
is sometimes the case if the food has been insufficient
during the first few months of life. Roentgenograms of
the bones may show the &ldquo;white line&rdquo; at the epiphyses first
described by Fraenkel (<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>) or a thickening of the
periosteum. However, too great reliance should not be
placed on these signs in making an early diagnosis of this
disorder, as neither is invariably present.</p>

<p>An instance of subacute scurvy, which in many respects
is typical, is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I. F., girl, was seen when 3 months old, weighing
somewhat over 8 pounds. She was given Schloss milk,
4 ounces, and then 5 ounces every three hours, and did
well, weighing 11&frac14; pounds two months later. As she
failed to gain for some weeks, although getting 6 ounces
of food, it was thought that this might be due to the fact
that she was getting pasteurized milk and had never received
an antiscorbutic. Autolyzed yeast had been tried as
a prophylactic antiscorbutic, but failed to bring about a
gain. When, however, orange juice was substituted for the
yeast, a prompt growth-reaction resulted, a gain of 1&frac14;
pounds in four weeks. Accompanying this lack of gain
in weight there were many of the other symptoms enumerated
above; irritability, pallor, slight tenderness of
the lower ends of the femora, albumin and a few red and
white cells in the urine. The pulse- or heart-beat was frequently
over 150, and the respiration 60 (Fig. 15). The
diagnosis of subacute scurvy was substantiated by the
prompt subsidence of all symptoms when orange juice
was administered.</p>
</blockquote>

temperature of substitution of orange juice (30 c.c.) for autolyzed yeast (30 c.c.) and a further

</div>

<p>Infantile scurvy may be dormant for a long time.
The diagnosis of <i>latent scurvy</i> is based mainly on the<span class="pagenum" title="186"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span>
reaction to specific therapy, on the marked improvement
when orange juice, tomato, potato or other antiscorbutic
food is given. The symptoms themselves are suggestive,
and do not enable an absolute diagnosis to be made. In
our experience with many cases of this kind the usual
course has been as follows: The infant has been generally
from 6 to 9 months of age, and fed for a considerable
period on pasteurized milk, which may or may not have
been prepared with cereal decoction. Nor has it been
material whether gruels also had been given. When about
6 months of age the baby ceased to thrive, to gain satisfactorily,
to look healthy, and to feed as it should. The
most careful investigation or physical examination has
failed to solve the difficulty. On the other hand, the history
of a diet of heated milk, especially if the quantity<span class="pagenum" title="187"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>
was not large, considered in conjunction with the pallor
and poor appetite, the increased knee-jerks, and perhaps
a rapid pulse and respiration (the cardiorespiratory syndrome),
has awakened suspicion. Orange juice or canned
tomato, prescribed in such cases with a view to diagnosis
as well as to treatment, frequently brings about a magic
result. The following case, the weight chart of which is
reproduced (<a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>), is fairly typical of this abnormal
nutritional state:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>H. S., boy, born December 15, 1915, was artificially
fed until January 4, 1916, when he weighed 6&frac12; pounds.
He was given 28 ounces of Schloss milk a day. (This
was prepared from pasteurized milk which was not heated
a second time. It contains per litre (quart) 140 c.c. of
whole milk, 140 c.c. of 20 per cent. cream, 50 g. of dextrimaltose,
5 g. of plasmon, 0.2 g. of potassium chlorate,
and 700 c.c. of water.) By March 1 he weighed 9
pounds, and gained three-quarters of a pound more in the
course of this month. During April he gained only 4
ounces. As will be seen from the chart, there was almost
a cessation of gain from April 10 to May 3, although yeast
was added to the diet. May 2, orange juice was given.
The weight advanced at once, the color and the general
appearance improved, and an eczematous condition of the
face rapidly healed. It will be noted from the chart that
the gain occurred, although the food intake remained
the same.</p>

<p>Epicrisis: A baby 4 months old with latent scurvy,
which existed since he was at least 3 months of age.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>This condition of latent scurvy is probably the commonest
type of the disorder, especially in the larger cities
where almost the entire milk supply for infants is pasteurized.</i>
It usually passes unrecognized. Most infants<span class="pagenum" title="188"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>
fortunately are given orange juice by the time they are 6
months of age, and may receive a small amount of vegetable
or potato before they are much older, so that they
are protected from serious harm in this way. But there
is no doubt a considerable number, especially those peculiarly
susceptible, who quite unbeknown to anyone pass
through the state of latent scurvy.</p>

<p>If this large group of cases were included in the incidence
of infantile scurvy, we should not look upon it as
a disorder which occurs rarely during the first six months
of life.</p>

<p>When scurvy goes unrecognized or untreated for a
long time, or the antiscorbutic content of the food is
exceptionally small, or the patient unusually susceptible,
the disorder may progress and resemble the advanced
cases described in connection with the adult type of this
disease. Happily such instances are rare. One of the
most typical and vivid descriptions of <i>an extreme case</i>
of infantile scurvy is that reported by Vincent:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The infant lay in its bed extremely apathetic and
barely conscious. Its face was ashy gray in color, the
respirations were extremely frequent, the pulse-rate was
144 per minute, and the temperature 103.2°. When
touched it moaned feebly, and made no attempt at movement.
The mouth was kept open, the lower jaw hanging
away from the face. There was a complete absence of
muscular tone, so that the infant appeared to be quite
incapable of voluntary movement.</p>

<p>The mouth presented a horrible appearance. No sign
of the teeth could be discovered, though it was stated that
several had appeared. All that could be seen was a purple
mass, which was so extensive that on superficial inspection
it was difficult to distinguish between the upper and<span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>
lower jaws, despite their wide separation. Scattered over
this purple mass were areas of necrosing tissue, the odor
of which was extremely unpleasant.</p>

<p>Petechial hemorrhages were distributed over the back
and limbs, and a large patch of extravasated blood was
found in the region of the left hip.</p>

<p>Tenderness was present in all the limbs, as manifested
by moaning and by the facial expression. There was a
general enlargement over both humeri throughout their
length; the ulna and radius did not appear to be thus
affected, but the index-finger of the right hand was enlarged,
especially at the junction of the metacarpal bone
with the first phalanx, the enlargement being at each side
of the joint. In the legs the signs were extreme. At both
knee-joints the skin was tightly stretched over the swollen
epiphyses; the tenderness also was greater than at
any other part.</p>

<p>Bleeding from the gums and nose had occurred; no
history of hæmaturia could be obtained. The motions
were semisolid, green, and offensive. During the last
twenty-four hours the infant had refused food.</p>

<p>The baby was given large amounts of lemon juice and
subcutaneous injections of salt solution and the necrosing
surfaces of the gums were scraped and swabbed with
boracic solution. By the third day the pulse was 100, the
temperature 99.8°, the odor from the mouth scarcely
noticeable, and the general condition distinctly improved.
It continued to improve and to gain in weight and when
seen at the end of the sixth week of treatment it was
doing well and was quite happy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will be well to consider in detail the signs and symptoms
which may develop in the course of scurvy.</p>

<p><b>Hemorrhage.</b>&mdash;<i>Hemorrhage of the gums</i> is one of the
characteristic signs of scurvy. For a reason not clearly
understood it involves first and foremost the tissues about<span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span>
the upper incisors. If, however, we fix our attention too
narrowly to this region we may be led into error; in several
instances we have first encountered hemorrhages about the
molar or the canine teeth, which had been overlooked because
the anterior part of the gums had been found normal.
Where teeth are absent or not in the course of eruption
hemorrhages do not appear. At the onset the gums may be
merely deep red or bluish red, especially if they overlie
upper incisors which are close to the surface. Hemorrhage
is particularly apt to occur where the edges of the
teeth have just broken through the mucous membrane.
In this connection the question arises as to whether every
hemorrhage of the gums in infants is to be considered a
sign of scurvy. This is a matter of some diagnostic importance.
We have seen hemorrhages of the gums at the
site of erupting molar teeth where, as prolonged observation
proved, not even latent scurvy existed. This sign
should not, therefore, be regarded as pathognomonic. In
two infants entirely free from scurvy we have noted
slight hemorrhage of the gums overlying incisor teeth.
It should be well understood that such an occurrence is
most exceptional; it is to be attributed probably to bacterial
invasion or to a constitutional hemorrhagic condition.
One of these cases was the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The infant was 8&frac12; months old. It had been nursed by
the mother up to this time and was well nourished, but
when first seen had some fever, probably due to a grippe
infection. About ten days later distinct linear hemorrhages
of the gums were noted over the two upper incisor teeth.
No treatment was instituted for this condition, and it
healed within a week. There was no subsequent sign of
similar hemorrhage or of other scorbutic manifestation
in the months that the baby was under observation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span></p>
<p>The localization of the hemorrhage in the gums is due
largely to trauma, occasioned by the sharp contact of the
jaws or of the nursing-bottle. Local infection plays
almost no rôle in infants, although in the adult where
there is caries of the teeth it frequently incites hemorrhage.
Dental caries and gingival infection may lead to
local hemorrhage, even where the nutritional conditions
are normal.</p>

<p>Subperiosteal hemorrhage is a sign distinctive of infantile
scurvy, although it must be borne in mind that it may
take place in the scurvy of adults. It involves most frequently
the lower end of the femur and the tibia, but
occurs in connection with the humerus, the mandible, the
scapula and other bones.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The hemorrhage usually manifests
itself as a swelling which appears suddenly at the
lower end of the femur or femora. It is brought about by
trauma, at times in the course of diapering, or by manipulation
in testing for local tenderness. The swelling is
very tender, and varies in size from an enlargement which
is difficult to appreciate, to one which renders the leg
fully twice its normal circumference (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>). It may
involve merely a small part of the long bone or extend up
or down the shaft for a long distance. As might be supposed
from the nature of this lesion, the enlargement persists
for weeks, frequently long after the gums and the
general symptoms have disappeared. During this period
it becomes harder and less tender, and may develop the<span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>
consistency of bone; it is in this stage that such swellings
have been diagnosed as new growths, and that incision or
even amputation of the leg has been resorted to. In subacute
cases the swelling&mdash;which must be regarded as
hemorrhagic rather than scorbutic&mdash;may be absorbed
gradually in spite of the fact that no antiscorbutic food
has been given. This has led to the mistaken conclusion
that the scurvy has been cured without dietetic treatment.</p>

<p>Subperiosteal hemorrhage may be clearly seen by
means of the fluoroscope or in X-ray photographs (Figs.
16 and 17). The shaft of the bone appears surmounted
by an elongated blood-clot, which is more or less distinct
according to its age and density. It may become calcified,
as clearly seen in figures. More often the periosteum
undergoes calcification or ossification, especially near the
site of the separation of the epiphysis. This gives rise
to a bizarre radiographic picture which may be difficult
to interpret&mdash;the opaque strip or streamer being almost
unrecognizable as periosteum (Fig. 17).</p>

<p>Hess and Unger observed that in several instances
where subperiosteal hemorrhage had been diagnosed,
X-ray examination disclosed that the swelling of the thigh
was due mainly to infiltration of the muscles and subcutaneous
tissue. It is surprising how an infiltration of
serum gives rise to a swelling which resembles in appearance
and consistency the classical subperiosteal tumor.</p>

<p>The skin, mucous membranes and subcutaneous tissues
are frequently the sites of hemorrhage. There is a difference
of opinion as to how frequently petechial hemorrhages
occur in scurvy, particularly as to whether they
are encountered early in this disorder. Great variation
in this regard may be noted in individuals and in groups
of cases occurring at different times. In the cases reported<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>
in 1914 by Hess and Fish, petechial hemorrhages
were frequently an early sign, to such an extent that they
led to a study of the blood and blood-vessels in this disorder.
The hemorrhages in this &ldquo;scurvy epidemic&rdquo; were
the result of a complication of scurvy with an infectious
disease. It is not necessary, however, for infection to
exist to bring about a rupture of the small vessels. The
idiosyncrasy of the individual has to be considered as well
as the fact that infants have a tendency to develop minute
skin hemorrhages, especially such as have an exudative
diathesis. In the course of scurvy, petechiæ may be found
not only in the skin, but in the mucosa of the mouth, especially
overlying the hard palate, and also in the palpebral
conjunctiva, identical with the minute petechiæ so significant
of general sepsis. In addition to these minute hemorrhages
larger ones are not infrequently found in various
parts of the body, especially in the neighborhood of the
joints. They appear as discolorations of various intensities
and shades, and are often interpreted as being merely
the result of bruises. These have been encountered most
often about the knee-joint, on the forehead, or in the
concha of the external ear, where they may best be seen
by means of transmitted light.</p>

<p>A form of hemorrhage which must be especially mentioned,
although it is very infrequent, is that taking place
into the orbit, leading to a <i>proptosis of the eyeball</i>, usually
the left (Still). This sign should be borne in mind, as it
occurs occasionally before other symptoms have rendered
the diagnosis clear, and may lead to a diagnosis of tumor.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, hemorrhages into the muscles or
between the muscle planes are very common in adults,
leading to hard swellings, the typical &ldquo;scurvy sclerosis.&rdquo;
Such effusions occur much less frequently in infants, due<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
probably to their lack of activity. In addition to these
hemorrhages there are serous effusions of the muscles
similar to those which are found in the pleural and pericardial
cavities. These effusions are very striking at
necropsy, when one incises the muscles&mdash;for example,
the muscles of the thigh. During life they are frequently
mistaken for subperiosteal hemorrhages.</p>

<p>Less frequently there are <i>hemorrhages into the internal
organs</i>. These, however, play a comparatively insignificant
rôle in the symptomatology of this disease. At
postmortem examination we find numerous hemorrhages
of the pleura, pericardium and peritoneum, which rarely
produce symptoms during life. Still records a case with
marked abdominal pain and swelling, which he believed
to have been due to hemorrhage into the wall of the intestine.
As previously mentioned, O&rsquo;Shea met with a case
of hemorrhage into the cæcum which was mistakenly operated
upon for appendicitis. Hæmothorax and hæemopericardium
occur, especially associated with local inflammatory
processes of tuberculous nature. The clinical aspect
of hemorrhage of the gastro-intestinal and the genito-urinary
tracts will be considered elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the scurvy of adults as well as that of infants, <i>the
nails and the hair</i> are altered by the nutritional condition.
Mention has been made of the hyperkeratosis recently
emphasized by Wiltshire as an early sign, occurring especially
on the thighs and legs. The skin is frequently dry,
the so-called &ldquo;goose skin&rdquo; that is seen in some poor
nutritional states. The nails are thin, brittle and lined;
at times small hemorrhages will be noted beneath them.
The hair also becomes thin and dry, and there is a tendency
for petechial hemorrhages to develop at the roots.</p>

<p>In a paper on the therapeutic value of yeast and of<span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>
wheat embryo the author called attention to the fact that
<i>eczema</i> may occur in connection with infantile scurvy,
and be cured by means of orange juice. We have met
with eight cases of eczema in infantile scurvy, which, in
almost every instance, have yielded promptly to an antiscorbutic,
thus proving their scorbutic nature. A case
of this kind is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>M. L., seven months old, was getting &ldquo;Molkenadaptierte&rdquo;
milk, and in addition autolyzed yeast. On May
25th it developed nasal diphtheria, but soon afterward
did well. On June 9th it was gaining, but its pulse was 160
and respirations 80. A few days later it developed
marked eczema about the neck and to a less extent on
the back and buttocks. The &ldquo;capillary resistance test&rdquo;
was negative. Cardiographic tracings showed merely a
simple tachycardia. A few days later petechial spots
appeared at the site of the eczema. On June 17th orange
juice was given. The appetite improved, the cardiorespiratory
syndrome disappeared, and the child began to
gain. The eczema also cleared up rapidly without any
local treatment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We wish to draw particular attention to this skin condition,
as it is generally not mentioned, or has been regarded
merely as a chance occurrence. The report of the
American Pediatric Society includes two cases of eczema
as a complicating condition. This symptom is of special
interest in view of the fact that a similar skin lesion
constitutes one of the typical signs of pellagra. In a
case of infantile scurvy we have seen an eruption at the
nape of the neck which was symmetrical and greatly resembled
that of pellagra. Andrews refers to the occurrence
of eczema in his description of infantile beriberi.</p>

<p>In a paper published a few years ago attention was<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>
drawn by Hess and Fish to the fact that infantile scurvy
frequently is associated with the exudative diathesis of
Czerny, a pathological condition which predisposes to the
development of exudations of the skin and the mucous
membranes. Infants suffering from this condition&mdash;intertrigo,
eczema, recurrent bronchitis&mdash;seem to be particularly
susceptible to scurvy and to develop it more quickly
than others.</p>

<p>As is well known, <i>edema</i> constitutes a not infrequent
symptom of adult scurvy. It has not, however, been accorded
any place in the symptomatology of infantile
scurvy. We do not refer to the edema in connection with
subperiosteal hemorrhage or separation of the epiphyses
of the long bones, but a mild and peculiar form which is
seen early in the disease. It involves most regularly
the upper eyelids, and the legs&mdash;especially the skin covering
the lower part of the tibiæ. In the latter site it differs
from edema as usually encountered, in that it does not
pit on pressure; it is firm, tense, causing some glossiness
of the overlying skin, which is rendered difficult to wrinkle
or to pinch between the fingers. Not infrequently the skin
is slightly reddened, a sign of interest, in view of a similar,
although much more intense, hyperæmia seen in pellegra.</p>

<p>In addition to this very mild edema there may be
marked swelling, resulting in what might be called, following
the terminology of beriberi, &ldquo;wet scurvy.&rdquo; The legs,
body and even the face may be swollen. This has been
frequently described in adult scurvy, and occasionally in
infantile scurvy. The first case of infantile scurvy described
in America, that of Northrup, had marked edema
of the scrotum. Edema is frequently met with in &ldquo;ship
beriberi,&rdquo; a disorder considered by some writers to be a
combination of beriberi and scurvy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span></p>
<p>The symptom leading to the diagnosis of scurvy most
often is <i>tenderness</i> or swelling of one of the extremities,
as the antecedent clinical signs, comprising latent scurvy,
are generally overlooked. These manifestations involve
usually the distal end of the thigh or thighs. The tenderness
is elicited most readily by pressure just above the
knee, which causes the baby to wince, and to quickly flex
the thigh, a reaction termed by Heubner &ldquo;the jumping-jack
phenomenon.&rdquo; As a result of pain and tenderness,
the leg lies often immobile in a state of pseudo-paralysis
(Fig. 18). There may be tenderness elsewhere than in
the long bones. Kerley refers to two cases showing tenderness
of the spine, and we have seen a similar case. Not
infrequently there is tenderness of the chest wall, the
earliest symptom noted by nurse or mother being unaccountable
crying whenever the baby is lifted by the thorax.
This is largely due to the sensitiveness of the ends of the
cartilage and bone which are pressed together at
their junction.</p>

</div>

<p>An early sign of infantile scurvy is <i>beading of the ribs</i>&mdash;the
development of a &ldquo;rosary&rdquo; similar to that characteristic
of rickets (Fig. 19). This has recently been described
by Hess and Unger in an article devoted to this
subject. That this rosary is truly scorbutic and not rhachitic
is proved by the fact that it recedes rapidly when
antiscorbutic foodstuff is given, and that it remains uninfluenced
by treatment with cod liver oil. A similar scorbutic
rosary occurs in guinea-pig scurvy, but has been
termed &ldquo;pseudo-rhachitic.&rdquo; It is important that this
sign should be recognized, as it is probable that much of
the confusion regarding the relationship and frequent
association of these two diseases is due to considering
the beading rhachitic. The interpretation of infantile<span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>
scurvy as &ldquo;acute rickets,&rdquo; the view held previous to the
writings of Barlow, was based largely on the development
of the rosary. To-day the error is made of regarding
early scurvy as chronic rickets; the rickets supposed
to be occasioned by a diet of condensed milk is probably
more often scurvy. This beading differs generally from
the round knobby &ldquo;rosary&rdquo; usually encountered. It is
more angular, the junction taking on a step-like form, as
if the abutting ends of the cartilage and the bone were of
unequal size, and not well fitted to each other. In the
accompanying radiograph (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>) it will be noted that
the &ldquo;beads&rdquo; present an irregular appearance.</p>

</div>

<p>In Figs. <a href="#Fig_6">6</a>, <a href="#Fig_16">16</a> and <a href="#Fig_17">17</a> will be seen illustrations of a <i>separation
of the epiphyses</i> of the head of the humerus, and
of partial and of complete separation of the lower ends of
the femora. This is a frequent lesion of fully developed
scurvy in infants, children, and even in young adults. It
is most frequent at the lower end of the femur, the upper
end of the tibia, the head of the humerus, and the costochondral
junctions. It is to these epiphyseal separations
that the term fracture or infraction usually refers. Union
is remarkably perfect even where no splint has been employed,
and nature has effected the cure (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>). Occasionally
there is some deformity, as when coxa vara
develops. The callus is often remarkably large; an old
callus sometimes undergoes destruction in the course
of scurvy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_020.png" width="400" height="353" alt="&ldquo;White line.&rdquo; Roentgenogram" />
<a id="Fig_20"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>&mdash;Radiograph. Infant 14 months of age, showing &ldquo;<i>white line</i>&rdquo; at wrist some
months after cure of scurvy.
</div>

<p>We have referred to use of röntgenograms in connection
with separation of the epiphyses, subperiosteal
hemorrhage, cardiac enlargement and beading of the ribs.
In addition to its application in these connections, the
X-ray may be of service to show a peculiar alteration of
the ends of the long bones&mdash;<i>the white line of Fraenkel</i>.<span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>
This is portrayed in Fig. 20. It is best seen at the lower
ends of the radius and femur, and appears as a white,
transverse, somewhat irregular band. Its diagnostic
value has been greatly exaggerated, as it is frequently not
present when the disease is advanced (observe radiographs
illustrating separation of the epiphyses). This
sign should therefore not be relied on for establishing the
diagnosis. Furthermore, changes may be seen in connection
with rickets (cases receiving antiscorbutic diet)
which are very difficult to differentiate from the &ldquo;white
line.&rdquo; It cannot be employed as a criterion of the progress
of the case, as it may persist for months after all
other signs and symptoms have disappeared.</p>

<p>The joints may be involved in scurvy. In most instances,
however, where swelling of the joints is diagnosed,
the lesion is periarticular. An effusion of serum
or of blood does occur occasionally into the joints and
has been found at operation, at necropsy, and by puncture.
If these effusions are allowed to go undisturbed, to be
absorbed as a result of antiscorbutic treatment, they
rarely suppurate. Czerny and Keller report the articular
fluid as invariably sterile.</p>

<p>The cardiovascular system has been given but scant
attention in connection with scurvy. Adults complain not
infrequently of palpitation and pain over the pericardium,
or rather of a tightness or oppression in the chest.
Little information is given regarding the size of the
heart. Darling described enlargement of the heart, especially
a right-sided hypertrophy, which he thought was
pathognomonic of the Rand type of scurvy. The pulse is
described in some cases as slow, and in others as rapid.
In descriptions of infantile scurvy the entire subject is
generally passed over without mention&mdash;for example, in<span class="pagenum" title="200"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span>
the excellent report of the American Pediatric Society
nothing whatsoever is stated regarding the heart&rsquo;s
action or the pulse. Barlow wrote: &ldquo;There is nothing to
note regarding the heart and lungs.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/fig_021.png" width="425" height="265" alt="Cardiac enlargement. Roentgenogram" />
<a id="Fig_21"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>&mdash;Radiograph. Scorbutic infant 14 months of age, showing cardiac enlargement and broadening of shadow at base of heart.
</div>

<p>In a paper written a few years ago, it was pointed
out by the author that there is frequently enlargement of
the heart, and more especially of the right heart. This
can be elicited at the bedside and has been substantiated
in numerous cases by means of the Röntgen-ray, which
demonstrates not only enlargement of the heart, but also
a marked broadening at its base, at the site of the large
vessels (Fig. 21). These phenomena resemble closely the
description of Reinhard in cases of beriberi.</p>

<p>Necropsy protocols usually are incomplete and unsatisfactory
in their descriptions of the heart. The excellent
monograph of Schoedel and Nauwerk, however,
which reports five careful necropsies, contains the following
data regarding three:</p>

<p>1. Pericardial fluid somewhat increased, both ventricles
moderately dilated, the right somewhat hypertrophic.</p>

<p>2. The heart showed a hypertrophy of the right and
left ventricles, as well as dilatation of the right ventricle.</p>

<p>3. The right ventricle dilated and slightly hypertrophied,
the muscles pale and tough.</p>

<p>In addition to this enlargement of the heart, or perhaps
associated with it, there is a combination of signs
which has been termed &ldquo;<i>the cardiorespiratory syndrome</i>&rdquo;
(Hess). It will be noted in the above description
of a case of subacute scurvy, that the pulse- or heart-beat
was frequently over 150, and the respiration 60. These
phenomena were noted in several instances before their
significance and intimate relationship to scurvy were realized.<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
The heart-beat not infrequently is found to be 200
per minute, and to be characterized by marked lability&mdash;increasing
to an astonishing degree as the result of slight
exertion or excitement. A mild febrile disturbance causing
a rise of temperature to little more than 100° F. will
send the pulse-rate up 30 beats. It must not be thought
that this refers to severe cases; the babies we have in mind
are similar to the one cited as an instance of subacute
scurvy. Apparently they are not ill, but show merely
some tenderness of the thighs, pallor, and the other minor
signs described. The cardiographic tracings showed a
simple tachycardia with an exceptionally tall T-wave in
some tracings, such as is commonly seen in exophthalmic
goitre (Fig. 22).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 601px;">

<a id="Fig_22"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;Electrocardiogram in case showing cardiorespiratory syndrome. Tachycardia with exceptionally tall T-wave.
</div>

<p>The rapidity of respirations is perhaps a more delicate
indicator of this disturbance than the pulse and has been
found to be markedly affected when the latter was merely
slightly increased in rate. For example, in one instance
the respirations were 64, 60 and 64 on three successive
days, while the pulse was 124, 141 and 136; in other words,
there was a 2:1 instead of the normal 4:1 pulse-respiration
ratio. The accompanying chart (<a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>) illustrates
the phenomenon in all its details better than a verbal
description. There is one point in connection with it,
to which especial attention should be called. This is a
reaction evident at a glance at the chart&mdash;the sharp drop
in the pulse and in the respiratory rate when orange juice
was given. It is the essence of the phenomenon; a therapeutic
response which proves that the rapidity is scorbutic
in nature.</p>

<p>The main involvement of the <i>respiratory system</i> in
scurvy is the polypn&oelig;a just described in connection with
the cardiorespiratory syndrome. There is no aphonia,<span class="pagenum" title="202"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>
a sign so typical of adult and of infantile beriberi, although
at times the voice is abnormal and whining. The
lungs frequently show some dullness posteriorly, which
may be due to engorgement or to the pressure of the
enlarged heart. Pneumonia is a frequent complication
and edema a terminal event. Hydrothorax associated
with hydropericardium is of frequent occurrence, and was
noted in the early description of this disease in adults
and in the first account of Barlow. These effusions rarely
progress to what may be termed the clinical degree and
under antiscorbutic treatment are rapidly absorbed.</p>

<p>It is commonly thought that scurvy does not involve
<i>the nervous system</i>; that this is a feature which distinguishes
it sharply from beriberi, another &ldquo;deficiency
disease.&rdquo; This view is incorrect, for the nervous system
is probably affected in many cases of scurvy. The rapidity
and lability of the pulse, combined with the rapid
respirations, would seem to be due to a disturbance of the
vagus mechanism. It is true that in beriberi the vagus is
involved to a still greater extent, especially its recurrent
laryngeal branch which brings about the characteristic
aphonia. In scurvy the knee-reflexes are generally increased.
Very rarely they are absent in infantile scurvy,
as described in adults. It is impossible to judge whether
the pain and tenderness in infants are due in part to a
sensitiveness of the nerve trunks as well as of the periosteum.
Careful studies in adult scurvy should furnish an
answer to this question. No methodical examination for
areas of anæsthesia or paræsthesia, signs which occur so
frequently in connection with beriberi, has been carried
out in scurvy. In certain epidemics, however, pains in the
limbs have been prominent symptoms.</p>

<p>The optic discs are generally pale in both infants and<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
in adults, with occasional signs of <ins title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: originally neur&oelig;dema">neuredema</ins>. Nyctalopia,
so frequently encountered, must be regarded as a
circulatory symptom rather than as one of nervous origin.</p>

<p>In a recent paper the author described a focal degeneration
of the lumbar cord in a case of infantile scurvy,
the lesion involving mainly the anterior horn cells (<a href="#Fig_3">Figs.
3</a> and <a href="#Fig_4">4</a>). In view of this report it would be well to
watch for corresponding clinical signs of involvement
of the spinal cord. Herpes has been described in connection
with both adult and infantile scurvy. In one of the
early cases in the American literature Fruitnight reported
a case with herpes in a girl five years of age. In considering
the rôle of the nervous system, mention should
be made of cases where sweating constituted an important
symptom. Finkelstein lays particular stress on this
symptom in infantile scurvy. We have not met with it
frequently; possibly it is due in part to complicating
rickets.</p>

<p>As would be expected, the nervous system is at times
the site of hemorrhage. Such lesions cannot, however,
be considered essentially nervous. For instance, hemorrhage
into the meninges may occur, as in the case of
Sammis, where there was &ldquo;a general clonic convulsion&rdquo;
before death, and a blood-clot 2&frac12; inches long by &frac12; inch
wide was found at necropsy between the dura and arachnoid.
Fife reported a similar case. Finkelstein also has
drawn attention to the occurrence of meningeal hemorrhage,
and Hess and Fish reported obtaining bloody cerebrospinal
fluid from a case with meningeal symptoms.
Recently Aschoff and Koch have depicted hemorrhages in
the sheath of the sciatic nerve, which undoubtedly must
have given rise to symptoms during life.</p>

<p>In view of many of these symptoms, especially those<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
involving the vagus, scurvy must be looked upon as a disorder
which may seriously affect the nervous system.
Furthermore, when we note the marked reaction brought
about by the antiscorbutic vitamine&mdash;for example, the
sharp fall in the rate of respirations and of pulse, as
shown in <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>, after giving orange juice, we must conclude
that the antiscorbutic vitamine functions, at least
indirectly as an antineuritic vitamine&mdash;that it must possess
this character to allay the various nervous signs of
this disorder.</p>

<p>The urinary system is frequently involved in the course
of scurvy. Among 38 cases Still reports that 89 per cent.
gave evidence of urinary changes and that 60 per cent.
showed hæmaturia. Finkelstein found urinary signs in
at least a third of his cases. Our figures, the result of a
study of subacute and mildly acute cases, correspond
more nearly with those of Finkelstein.</p>

<p>The occurrence of pronounced renal hemorrhage as a
first symptom of scurvy is emphasized in many descriptions
of this disease, and has impressed itself in the minds
of physicians. It is true that this occurs sometimes at
the onset, as does hemorrhage into or about the joints, or
hemorrhage behind the eyeball. It is well to bear these
possibilities in mind, but they must be regarded as very
exceptional early signs of this disorder. We have encountered
frank hæmaturia but once in the early stage of
infantile scurvy. The blood emanates generally from the
kidneys, although the submucous hemorrhages of the
bladder as well as in the urethra, described both in man
and in guinea-pigs, indicate that the blood in the urine
may have its origin lower down in the tract. This bleeding
should be regarded not as a sign of nephritis, but
rather as a hemorrhagic manifestation. It is less frequent<span class="pagenum" title="205"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>
in adults than in infants. O&rsquo;Shea reports some degree
of hemorrhage in 15 per cent. of his cases (adults).</p>

<p>A true nephritis, however, may occur in connection
with scurvy. There may be albumen and many casts, or a
urine loaded with casts and cylindroids. These peculiar
casts may appear suddenly, as in the alimentary intoxication
of infants, and disappear just as rapidly when
antiscorbutic treatment is given. The urine may contain
a large number of pus cells as in pyelitis. This condition
may be accompanied by irregular fever, but in two instances
we have encountered it where the temperature
was normal. It is to be regarded, probably, merely as one
of the manifestations of secondary infection so commonly
associated with scurvy. Some pus cells may continue
to be present in the urine for a period of months.
This is likewise true of the red cells. We have under
observation at present an infant which had subacute
scurvy almost three years ago and still has red blood-cells
in the urine.</p>

<p>Oliguria is a common symptom of both adult and infantile
scurvy. Lind mentioned this symptom, and in this
connection remarks on the beneficent effect of antiscorbutic
treatment. Charpentier called attention to the fact
that in a case of scurvy the urine decreased from 1250 g.
to 800 g. The report of the American Pediatric Society
mentions scanty urine in 9 cases and suppression of urine
in one. This sign, however, was not emphasized until
recently, when Gerstenberger, and Hess and Unger drew
attention to its frequent occurrence in infants. It has
some diagnostic significance and should be borne in mind
where a decreased excretion of urine is reported. A
counterpart of this symptom is the sudden outpouring
of urine frequently noted after antiscorbutic treatment<span class="pagenum" title="206"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>
has been instituted. This polyuria accounts for the loss
of weight or lack of gain which sometimes accompanies
unmistakable general improvement, and which is difficult
otherwise to understand (Fig. 23). It is interesting to
learn that oliguria occurs commonly in both adult and
infantile beriberi.</p>

<p>One of the earliest, as well as one of the most constant
symptoms of scurvy, is a <i>lack of appetite</i>. It is a typical
sign of latent scurvy, although occasionally we have met
with cases where the appetite remained unimpaired until
the hemorrhagic stage was reached. In adults there is
sometimes bulimia and a marked capriciousness of the
appetite. Anorexia is a true scorbutic symptom, disappearing
with remarkable rapidity when antiscorbutic food
is given, and not capable of alleviation by tincture of
<ins title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: originally genitian">gentian</ins> or other vegetable bitters. Whether it depends
upon a lack of secretions in the gastro-intestinal tract<span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
is not known, as there has been no thorough study of this
aspect of the disorder. The hydrochloric acid generally
is deficient in cases of scurvy. Recently McCarrison has
laid emphasis on the importance of the impairment of
the digestion and assimilative function in scurvy. This
subject gains added interest in view of the recent reports
of Uhlmann as well as of Voegtlin, showing that water-soluble
vitamine acts as a stimulant for the various secretions
of the gastro-intestinal tract.</p>

<p>As a result of McCollum&rsquo;s statement that scurvy is
due mainly to <i>constipation</i>, marked attention has been
directed recently to the action of the bowels in this disorder.
This question has been discussed in the chapter
on etiology, and, therefore, will be referred to in this
place merely from the clinical viewpoint. In our experience
the activity of the bowel varies greatly in cases of
latent or subacute scurvy. In a great many instances it
has been normal; more often there has been slight constipation,
and exceptionally there has been irregular diarrh&oelig;a.
In other words, no causative relationship or parallelism
could be observed between the emptying of the
intestinal tract and the development of scurvy. This in
general has been the experience of others. In the report
of the American Pediatric Society the bowels are stated
as having been regular in 74 cases, irregular in 15, constipated
in 126, and diarrh&oelig;al in 65. It may be added
that we were unable to cure scurvy by means of liquid
petrolatum or phenolphthalein, either in infants or in
guinea-pigs, and likewise unable to protect guinea-pigs
from scurvy by means of various laxatives. On the other
hand, opium given in the form of the camphorated tincture
did not lead to an intensification of the symptoms,<span class="pagenum" title="208"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span>
although, in one case, the bowels did not move for over
three days.</p>

<p>As complications involving the gastro-intestinal tract
may be mentioned the vomiting of blood, which is stated
in the above report as occurring in 2 of the 361 cases,
as well as bleeding from the bowel, which was noted in
37 cases, in 12 of which there was bloody diarrh&oelig;a. However,
these are late symptoms, and correspond to the mycotic
ulcers which are so frequently found, especially in
the large intestine, in cases of scurvy. Mention may
again be made of the fact that hemorrhages may occur
under the peritoneum and give rise to symptoms simulating
appendicitis or general peritonitis.</p>

<p>Jaundice has been described in connection with certain
epidemics of scurvy. To our knowledge it has not been
reported in infants.</p>

<p>The presence of worms has been frequently reported
in the bowel or in the stool of patients suffering from
beriberi. There have been no similar investigations in
relation to scurvy. It would be interesting to inquire into
this question, as it is quite possible that a lack of antiscorbutic
foodstuff may favor the presence of parasites in
the intestinal canal.</p>

<p>Before closing this consideration of the involvement
of the alimentary tract, we would call attention to the
relation of stomatitis to scurvy. Among adults this is
a common complication. In infants it is uncommon, due
to the absence of carious teeth and secondary infection;
we have encountered it in but two instances. Stomatitis
is of importance in this connection, as it frequently develops
on the basis of malnutrition, scurvy being one of
the disorders which may constitute the substratum. Such
may be the case where stomatitis occurs in epidemic form<span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>
&mdash;for example, among large bodies of troops. It may be
remarked that stomatitis at times was a very common
disease among the soldiers in the recent war.</p>

<p>Scurvy is associated with an alteration of both <i>the
blood and the blood-vessels</i>. The characteristic pallor,
which is one of the most common as well as earliest symptoms,
is due in a large measure to the anemia. This
anemia is of the secondary type, but has definite peculiarities,
and does not resemble that encountered in the
course of tuberculosis, rickets or marasmus. The hemoglobin
is greatly diminished, far out of proportion to the
decrease in the number of the red cells. Not infrequently
we will find a hemoglobin index of 0.5. Table 4, above
taken from the article on this subject by Hess and
Fish (1914), brings out the details of the blood-picture.<span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>
It shows that there may be a polycythemica,
which may persist after the other signs of the
disorder have disappeared. Brandt has recently made
similar observations, reporting in one instance over ten
million red cells two months after treatment. In soldiers
suffering from scurvy Wassermann has encountered cases
where, during convalescence, the red-cell count has risen
to over six or seven millions and the hemoglobin to 110 or
120 per cent. Under the microscope the red cells show
poikilocytosis, anisocytosis and a lack of hemoglobin;
they are slightly enlarged, with the occasional occurrence
of exceptionally large cells resembling the &ldquo;dropsical
cells&rdquo; described in connection with chlorosis. Sometimes
a few nucleated red cells and myeloblasts are seen;
megaloblasts are also reported.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> The blood-picture bears
a remarkable similarity to that of chlorosis, a point of
interest, in view of the fact that both scurvy and chlorosis
have been attributed to a disordered function of the
endocrine glands. The &ldquo;dropsical cells&rdquo; suggest a disturbance
of the salt balance in the plasma. In some cases
we have found a decreased fragility of the red cells, which
also has been described in chlorosis.</p>

<p>The total number of leucocytes is slightly increased.
In our cases the mononuclear cells have averaged 66 per
cent., which is somewhat high even for infants. This has
been the experience of Labor, who, however, also describes
an eosinophilia during convalescence, a phenomenon which
we have not encountered. Some describe a marked increase
in the polynuclear cells, which, probably, is to be<span class="pagenum" title="211"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>
regarded as the reaction to secondary infections. There
is indeed a marked difference of opinion in regard to the
morphology of the blood in scurvy in adults as well as
in infants. Some found a large number of one type of
cell&mdash;for example, nucleated red cells, myelocytes, eosinophiles&mdash;whereas
others have failed to observe an increase
of these cells. The divergent reports probably should be
attributed to the fact that the investigators are describing
scurvy of various grades of severity, of different
stages of development, or complicated by intercurrent
disease.</p>

<p>Nobécourt, Tixier, and Maillet have questioned
whether there is always complete recovery from this
anemia, which is severe from the standpoint of hemoglobin
and iron. The older authors reported instances where
men have been weakly and ailing for the remainder of
their lives after an attack of scurvy. In some infants
pallor and anemia may persist for months after apparent
cure; however, this is the exception rather than
the rule.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that scurvy frequently is classed
as a hemorrhagic disease, and that hemorrhages play such
an important rôle in its symptomatology, a consideration
of the factors concerned in the <i>coagulability of the blood</i>
is of interest. In an investigation (Hess and Fish) it
was found that the oxalated plasma (of blood taken directly
from a vein) showed a slightly delayed coagulation
time&mdash;eight to fourteen minutes. The &ldquo;bleeding time&rdquo;
carried out according to the simple method of Duke was
slightly increased. Holt reports a case where a child
bled to death following incision into an epiphyseal swelling
at the lower end of the femur. The number of blood
platelets is increased, running parallel, as is usually the<span class="pagenum" title="212"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span>
case, with the number of red cells (<a href="#TABLE_4">Table 4</a>). This increase
in the blood-platelets, recently confirmed by Tobler and
by Brandt, is a very exceptional phenomenon, and was not
anticipated in connection with a disorder characterized
by hemorrhage. The antithrombin content of the plasma
is normal.</p>

<p>The investigation was directed to a study of the integrity
of the blood-vessels in order to account for the hemorrhages.
To this end the &ldquo;capillary resistance test&rdquo; was
devised.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> In the majority of cases this was found to be
&ldquo;positive&rdquo; (the blood-vessels showing an increased permeability)
and to become negative when antiscorbutics
were given and the symptoms disappeared. This shows
that the cellular structure of the vessels is altered in the
course of scurvy, and indicates probably that this is an
important cause of the hemorrhages. The edema of the
face and ankles, the outflow of serum into the body cavities
and into the muscles (Barlow) must be regarded as
other evidences of the inadequacy of the vessel walls.
The tendency of children with exudative diathesis to develop
scurvy is perhaps still another manifestation of
vascular weakness. This point of view has been strengthened
recently by the pathological studies of Aschoff and
Koch, who regard scurvy as a nutritional disorder in<span class="pagenum" title="213"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span>
which there is a lack of some colloidal substance needed
for the normal structure of the vessels.</p>

<p>When one makes a subcutaneous puncture in infants
suffering from scurvy, a small hemorrhage very often
develops at the site of the puncture wound. This is not
the case when one makes a hypodermic puncture in a
normal person or in a hemophiliac, although it does
occur in cases of purpura. This &ldquo;stick test&rdquo; is not a
constant sign of scurvy, but, like the capillary resistance
test, was found in many cases and disappeared with the
subsidence of the disorder. It shows that the cells of the
skin and subcutaneous tissues are affected, and possibly
that their thromboplastic power is diminished.</p>

<p><b>Nutrition and Growth.</b>&mdash;The general nutrition suffers in
scurvy as the disease progresses. It is a mistake, however,
to picture the scorbutic individual, either adult or
infant, as in a state of malnutrition. Not infrequently
he appears well nourished, an appearance which is heightened
by the slight edema of the face. Infants generally
for a period of weeks or months preceding the onset maintain
a stationary weight. This may be the only sign of
the scorbutic condition. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An infant seen in 1915 gained about one-half a pound
during the months of February, March, April and May.
At this time it was somewhat over 9 months of age and
had never received raw milk or other antiscorbutic food.
In June it was given orange-peel juice, and gained 2
pounds within a month. There were no other scorbutic
signs or symptoms, and no loss of appetite during the
months of February and March, although the baby was
suffering from a progressive scurvy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The growth impulse of the body throughout an attack
of scurvy remains unimpaired, being merely in an inactive<span class="pagenum" title="214"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span>
or quiescent state. <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a> shows this very well, demonstrating
that when an antiscorbutic food is added to the
dietary the gain may be abnormally great&mdash;there may be
supergrowth. Generally such marked increases are due
to an increase in the consumption of food, following the
stimulation of the appetite. However, decided gain in
weight may follow the giving of orange juice or other
antiscorbutic despite the fact that the intake of food is
maintained at the same level.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/fig_024.png" width="450" height="384" alt="Development of scurvy in spite of normal gain in weight" />
<a id="Fig_24"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span>&mdash;Development of scurvy in spite of normal gain in weight in a baby who had been
underfed since birth.
</div>

<p>Although it may be stated as a principle that the
development of scurvy is accompanied by a failure to
gain in weight, there are exceptions to this rule. Under
certain conditions the weight may follow a perfectly
normal course during the entire period. Fig. 24 illustrates
this clinical paradox:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="215"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A baby was seen in January, when it was 7&frac12; months
of age. Toward the end of February, in spite of constant
and normal gain in weight, he manifested unmistakable
signs of scurvy&mdash;peridental hemorrhage over the upper
incisor teeth, which were erupting, and tenderness of the
lower ends of the femora. The scorbutic nature of these
signs were substantiated by their prompt subsidence on
the administration of orange juice. We explain the phenomenon
as follows: This baby had been starved in a two-fold
sense throughout the first months of its life&mdash;it had
received a diet lacking in caloric value as well as deficient
in antiscorbutic vitamine. Its growth impulse had been
held in abeyance for months by both of these factors.
When sufficient calories were supplied in the dietary,
growth was no longer repressed, and a steady gain resulted
in spite of the continued inadequacy of the antiscorbutic
factor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has been shown that during the period of infancy
undernourishment must be extreme to occasion stunting
of growth in length. In animals Aron demonstrated that
lack of nutrition led to a decrease of the fat and of the
muscle of the body, but that the skeleton nevertheless
continued to grow, and the ash content of the body to
increase. In marasmus, or infantile atrophy, the baby
usually grows in length, although its weight remains stationary
or decreases. In scurvy we have shown that
there is frequently a definite retardation of growth in
length, an observation which has been recently confirmed
by Epstein in babies which developed this disorder in the
foundling asylum of Prague during the war. This fact
shows how profoundly the metabolism must be disturbed
by this disorder. Figure 25 portrays this retardation in
growth and the sharp reaction when orange juice was
added to the dietary. It also demonstrates that the growth<span class="pagenum" title="216"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></span>
impulse remains unimpaired and capable of quick response
when the essential food factor is furnished.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/fig_025.png" width="450" height="351" alt="Retardation of growth in length when no orange juice was given and supergrowth when given once more" />

was given and supergrowth when it was given once more, O. J.=orange juice. O. P. J.=
orange-peel juice. Lower curve represents the normal.
</div>

<p><b>Fever.</b>&mdash;Fever frequently accompanies scurvy. It is
generally of a low grade, ranging between 100° and
101°, as may be seen in <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>. There is a difference
of opinion as to whether the rise of temperature
should be considered as truly scorbutic in nature,
as &ldquo;scorbutic fever,&rdquo; or regarded merely as a condition
grafted upon the nutritional disturbance. A phenomenon
which might seem to argue for its essential scorbutic
character is the sharp subsidence on giving antiscorbutic
food. On the other hand, this may quite as well be interpreted
as due to a secondary reaction, checking<span class="pagenum" title="217"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span>
the absorption of toxins or bacteria. High temperatures&mdash;for
example, fever of 103° or over&mdash;are attributable to a
complicating infection and should lead to careful examination
for the source of the trouble; pyelitis should
particularly be borne in mind. In a recent case fever of
uncertain origin disappeared following the transfusion
of blood.</p>

<p>We have already considered numerous <i>complications</i>
of scurvy, and shall therefore not go over this ground
again. Many of them are due to hemorrhages or to
serous effusions in various parts of the body. Another
large group in adults as well as in infants are the result
of infection. The respiratory tract is particularly susceptible,
pneumonia constituting the most common cause
of death. In infants we meet with frequent attacks of
&ldquo;grippe,&rdquo; widespread occurrence of <i>nasal diphtheria</i>,
furunculosis and torpid ulcers of the skin, pyelitis, otitis,
adenitis, etc. We have encountered nasal diphtheria&mdash;with
typical bloody mucous discharge&mdash;so frequently in
connection with scurvy, that where this local infection
occurs among a group of infants they should be carefully
examined for latent or mild scurvy. Aschoff and Koch
recently have laid emphasis on the frequency with which
diphtheria complicated scurvy among adults (soldiers).
Dysentery is another complication resulting from an invasion
of bacteria. Local infections occur more often in
adults than in infants&mdash;cervical adenitis following gingival
pyorrh&oelig;a, &ldquo;bubo&rdquo; of the groin following infection
of the lower extremity, abscess of the calf of the leg
following hemorrhage into this region.</p>

<p>Scurvy sometimes occurs in <i>epidemic form</i>, especially
in the army, but also, as in Russia, among the civilian
population. This results when a large group of individuals<span class="pagenum" title="218"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span>

have been maintained on a limited and inadequate
ration, and especially where this nutritional condition is
complicated by intercurrent infection. It should not be
interpreted as evidence of the bacterial origin of scurvy.
A few years ago the author reported an epidemic of
scurvy in connection with an outbreak of grippe in an
infant asylum. Twelve infants in one ward were affected.
The signs were atypical&mdash;an undue degree of hemorrhage
occurring at atypical sites (Table 5). It will be noted
from the table that the ages of the infants, the distribution<span class="pagenum" title="219"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>
of the hemorrhages, the development of signs (in some
instances) in spite of antiscorbutic treatment, the sharply defined
epidemic character, distinguish these cases from
the scurvy commonly seen. This is an instance where
latent scurvy was prematurely changed to acute scurvy
by an intercurrent ward infection; an epidemic of grippe
precipitated a pseudo-epidemic of scurvy. It is important,
especially for army surgeons, to bear in mind that
where latent scurvy exists a bacterial invasion will lend
the disorder a hemorrhagic character. This has been
noted during the recent war in connection with typhus
fever on the Eastern front, and was remarked upon
during the Crimean War and our War of the Rebellion.
Some years ago Wherry made a similar observation in
the course of experiments with the plague bacillus&mdash;guinea-pigs
fed on a cereal diet developed far more hemorrhages
subsequent to infection than those which received
cabbage in addition.</p>

<h3>DIAGNOSIS</h3>

<p>A correct and early <i>diagnosis</i> of scurvy is the more
important in view of the fact that we possess a specific
remedy, and that the disorder is not self-limited. Recognition
generally presents little difficulties for those who
have seen cases, but is a stumbling block where the symptomatology
has been gleaned merely from the textbooks.
It has been our experience that medical students who were
conversant with scurvy from a theoretical standpoint
failed to diagnose a case presented to them in the clinic.
Where diagnosis is uncertain, the most important aid
is an exact knowledge of the previous diet, and observation
of the reaction of the patient to antiscorbutic treatment.
These diagnostic points should be constantly remembered<span class="pagenum" title="220"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span>
in relation to the discussion which follows,
and will not be reiterated in the differentiation of scurvy
from the various other diseases.</p>

<p>The scurvy of adults and of infants are very similar.
The main difference is the subjective symptoms in the
adult&mdash;pains in various parts of the body&mdash;and the fact
that the gums are frequently the site of infection and
ulceration, as well as of hemorrhage. It might be thought
that when scurvy occurs in epidemic form it would be
readily recognized, but experience shows that for months
it may permeate the ranks of troops or the inmates of
almshouses, and pass as rheumatism. This is the cardinal
diagnostic error in adult as well as in infantile scurvy&mdash;time
and again, and in spite of urgent and repeated warnings,
patients continue to be treated for <i>rheumatism</i>.
Holt writes: &ldquo;In fully four-fifths of the cases which have
come to my own notice this (rheumatism) has been the
previous diagnosis.&rdquo; Such has been our experience.
The diagnosis should not be difficult. In sporadic cases,
the individual has limited his diet usually on account of
indigestion, or diarrh&oelig;a, or following some dietetic whim
or medical advice given months previously. Where
scurvy occurs <i>en masse</i> it may follow an inability to
obtain fresh food&mdash;as during war, on shipboard, in the
Tropics or in the Arctic regions&mdash;or be the result of a
misplaced reliance on some article of food&mdash;for example,
dehydrated vegetables. More careful investigation will
disclose that the &ldquo;rheumatic&rdquo; pains and tenderness are
not in the joints but in the muscles and tendons. The
calf muscles are frequently painful and excessively tender
and somewhat swollen or infiltrated; the hamstring
tendons or the tendo Achilles may be sore and slightly
swollen and the site of slight subcutaneous hemorrhages.<span class="pagenum" title="221"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a></span>
In some cases there is bone tenderness, pain on percussion
of the shins or of the sternum. These signs may be
accompanied by, or even precede, hemorrhages in the
gums. The diagnosis of rheumatism in infants indicates
a lack of knowledge of pediatrics, as this disease is hardly
ever encountered in babies under a year and a half of age.</p>

<p>It is not always easy to differentiate scurvy from
<i>purpura</i>. In either disease the gums may be hemorrhagic
and swollen, there may be scattered subcutaneous hemorrhages
and pains in the limbs. Occasionally, as in a case
seen a few years ago, we may be forced to resort to the
dietetic test. A close inquiry into the previous diet,
however, a history of previous attacks of purpura, the
number, and especially the large size, of the subcutaneous
hemorrhages, and above all, the diminished number of
blood-platelets, should make diagnosis possible. In
scurvy the platelets are almost always over 300,000 per
cubic millimetre, whereas in purpura they are reduced
to less than 200,000.</p>

<p>In the army it may be difficult to distinguish scurvy
from <i>beriberi</i>, especially if they occur side by side as
in the recent English campaign in Mesopotamia. There
may be a combination of the two diseases, a picture similar
to ship-beriberi, regarded by Nocht as a hybrid of these
diseases. The diagnosis is rendered more difficult, as
at times scurvy is associated with signs of neuritis. We
shall have to depend on the involvement of the gums and
the hemorrhages in scurvy, and on the hyperæsthesia,
paræsthesia, and anæsthesia in beriberi; marked edema
points to the latter disease.</p>

<p>We have thus far had in mind frank and outspoken
cases of scurvy. When we come to consider latent or
early cases, the diagnosis is more difficult and may have<span class="pagenum" title="222"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></span>
to be merely tentative. All that need be added, in view
of the clinical picture sketched above, is that this condition
should not be forgotten in treating adults who have
malaise and indefinite &ldquo;rheumatic&rdquo; pains and, more particularly,
in relation to infants who fail to gain, whose
appetite is capricious, whose disposition has become fretful
and who have developed the sallow scorbutic complexion.
This warning is particularly opportune at present
in the United States, where pasteurized milk is fed so
extensively to infants, and an antiscorbutic food is not
always given.</p>

<p>In addition to the symptoms just enumerated, tenderness
of the bones, especially of the distal ends of the
femora, should be sought for, the urine should be examined
carefully for red blood-cells, and perhaps the ends
of the long bones radiographed for &ldquo;the white line&rdquo;
of Fraenkel.</p>

<p>The experience of Comby with infantile scurvy is illuminating.
Among the fifty-five cases which he has seen,
the diagnosis was erroneous in forty-five, and among
thirteen cases recently met with, the physician failed to
recognize the disorder in all but two. The infants had
been given sodium salicylate, had been treated with electricity
and massage for the supposed acute poliomyelitis,
or given mercury for syphilis, or incisions or trephining
had been carried out for acute osteomyelitis. Some had
been put into plaster casts for coxalgia or for Potts&rsquo;
disease. This experience requires little comment. It
should be added, however, that in the course of an epidemic
of poliomyelitis, such mistakes are apt to happen,
and, to our knowledge, did occur in the recent epidemic.</p>

<p>In regard to &ldquo;<i>the pseudo-paralysis&rdquo; of congenital
syphilis</i> diagnosed as scurvy, it should be remembered<span class="pagenum" title="223"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span>
that this lesion occurs almost always before the fifth month
of life. A history of previous papular eruption, the
bilateral enlargement of the epitrochlear glands, and
the Wassermann test should suffice to establish the correct
diagnosis.</p>

<p>Besides the clinical conditions enumerated above,
we may add the following, which have been confused
with scurvy: Neuritis, hemorrhagic nephritis, calculus
of the urinary tract, renal tumor, orbital tumor,
appendicitis, peritonitis, pleurisy and pneumonia. Holt
writes as follows: &ldquo;I have known two cases to be operated
upon by eminent surgeons, once with a diagnosis of
sarcoma and once of ostitis of both tibiæ. Not until the
subperiosteal hemorrhages and epiphyseal separations
were discovered was the nature of the trouble suspected.&rdquo;
Recently we saw a case of fracture of the distal end of the
femur diagnosed as infantile scurvy; the baby had caught
its thigh between the bars of the crib and snapped the
bone in trying to extricate itself. Finkelstein adds acute
endocarditis, hemorrhagic septicæmia with multiple bone
swellings, and leukæmia as having been confused
with scurvy.</p>

<p>In an interesting account of scurvy in the Russian
army during the recent war, Hoerschelman states that
tired soldiers at times feign scurvy. They produce a
&ldquo;pseudo-scurvy&rdquo; by means of scratching the gums with
their nails or rubbing them with tobacco, and at the same
time bring about hemorrhages of the skin by means
of trauma.</p>

<p>Scurvy in the breast-fed infant has been fully considered
under etiology. We wish merely to state again
that one cannot be too cautious in venturing this diagnosis
in a nursing baby. The great majority of reported<span class="pagenum" title="224"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span>
cases are not scurvy, but bacterial infections, syphilis, or
various forms of intoxication. In establishing a diagnosis
the same principles hold as in the case of bottle-fed
infants.</p>

<p>The most important consideration in the diagnosis of
scurvy is to keep in mind the heterogeneous character of
its symptoms, and the manifold diseases with which it
may be confused. Surgeons should be alert to this danger
when about to perform operations for osteomyelitis or
bone tumor. The mistakes occur because cases are infrequently
seen and because the signs, being dependent
largely upon hemorrhage, occur in such varied locations
of the body. Where diagnosis cannot be made from the
signs or symptoms, the most important aid is a thorough
acquaintance with the previous diet of the individual and
observation of his reaction to antiscorbutic treatment.</p>

<h2><span class="fs85">CHAPTER VIII</span><br />
PROGNOSIS</h2>


<p>The outcome of scurvy, as we encounter it in peace
time in the Temperate Zone, is generally favorable, so that
it plays but an insignificant rôle in our mortality statistics.
This results from the fact that we are abundantly
provided with a specific remedy, so that if the diagnosis
is made early and treatment is prompt and thorough,
the patient will rapidly recover and suffer no physical
disability. Where antiscorbutic foodstuffs are not procurable,
however, this disease constitutes a terrible
scourge, causing many deaths and spreading among an
army, a ship&rsquo;s crew, or among the civil population with
the rapidity of an epidemic. For example, the ships of
the East India Company in their voyages round the Cape
often lost nearly one-half of their crews, and in Lord
Anson&rsquo;s famous voyage round the world 380 out of 510
seamen perished from the disease. Moreover, if the antiscorbutic
treatment is inadequate or the patient goes
untreated for a long period, the cure may be incomplete,
a condition of malnutrition and weakness developing,
which may persist for years. To appreciate this clinical
condition we must refer to the account of physicians who
saw thousands of cases of severe and untreated scurvy
among the sailors, who were of necessity deprived of aid
until they reached land. Lind laid stress on a type of
this disease which developed under these circumstances
and which he termed &ldquo;obstinate scurvy.&rdquo; He writes:
&ldquo;I have met with numerous instances not only among
the common seamen, but of officers, with whom it had<span class="pagenum" title="226"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span>
taken such deep root in the constitution as to prove a
lasting affliction to them during a great part of their lives.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Persons are likewise subject in different periods
of their life afterwards to habitual rheumatism, pains and
stiffness in their joints; and sometimes eruptions on the
skin.&rdquo; In his treatise on scurvy, published in 1685,
Harvey refers to this chronic nutritional disorder as
&ldquo;inveterate scurvy.&rdquo; He pictures patients who had gone
untreated for a long time as &ldquo;molested with vagrant,
ambulative, distending, creeping, vellicating or lancinating
pains of several parts of the body.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They are
often loose and subject to falling into violent fluxes of the
belly, diarrh&oelig;a and lienteries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Infants as well as adults usually recover rapidly and
completely from scurvy, the result depending largely upon
the early recognition of the disease. We must always
bear in mind, however, that from a histologic standpoint
the cure is not simultaneous with the magic disappearance
of the clinical symptoms, but that months probably
elapse before the tissues return to their normal state.
It is difficult to give reliable mortality statistics for infantile
scurvy, for so many cases are of the rudimentary
form that percentages are necessarily misleading. Still
writes that in 5 out of 64 cases the disease proved fatal
by diarrh&oelig;a and exhaustion. The American Pediatric
Society reports 29 deaths out of 397 cases, which gives a
similar mortality percentage. When infantile scurvy was
not so generally recognized by physicians the mortality
was much higher, and we find that Barlow encountered
7 deaths in his first series of 31 cases.</p>

<p>Even when the child recovers it may not regain its
normal health if it has continued for a prolonged period in
a state of chronic scurvy. It may remain pale and fail to<span class="pagenum" title="227"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span>
gain in weight in spite of a liberal and well-balanced diet.
Cases of this kind are not infrequent. In this connection
it is worthy of note that 4 of the 41 cases of &ldquo;c&oelig;liac disease,&rdquo;
an interesting intestinal condition described by
Still, had scurvy just before or during the onset of the
disease. This observation conforms to the experience
that chronic bowel disorders often follow in the wake of
adult scurvy.</p>

<p>In adults the heart may be weakened by scurvy, and
death may result from cardiac failure. Cardiac disturbances
occur also in infantile scurvy. This involvement
might be expected, in view of the tachycardia (cardiorespiratory
phenomenon) which is so frequent a symptom
of infantile scurvy. The heart may be rapid for months
or even for years after the disorder, and tachycardia
may develop on the occasion of even a mild infectious disease.
For example, a fever of 101°, due to a common
coryza, may cause the heart-beat to rise to perhaps 180
a minute. Children so affected succumb readily to infection,
especially to pneumonia, which may lead to sudden
collapse followed by death.</p>

<p>An important factor in the prognosis of scurvy, as in
that of other disorders due to a lack of vitamines, is the
marked susceptibility to infection. Even latent or subacute
scurvy causes a peculiar susceptibility to diphtheria
(especially the nasal type), to coryza, bronchitis,
and pneumonia. A perusal of the literature shows that
this susceptibility was noted by the older authors in
relation to adults.</p>

<p>The local signs usually disappear quickly without leaving
any trace. The hemorrhages are absorbed and the
eczema heals within a few days. The fractures unite
promptly with the formation of an unusually large callus.<span class="pagenum" title="228"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>
The urine, which may have contained red blood-cells or
have been markedly hemorrhagic, quickly becomes normal
and, in our experience, gives no further evidence of renal
damage. Still reports, however, the case of a frail child
who had a trace of albumen in the urine two years after
an attack of scurvy. A rare local injury, which may lead
to death, is cerebral hemorrhage. Recently Sammis reported
a case of this kind, which was characterized by
convulsions during life, and in which subdural hemorrhage
was found at necropsy.</p>

<p>If we acknowledge an individual idiosyncrasy to
scurvy we should expect a tendency to a recurrence of
the disease. Lind was of this opinion, stating that &ldquo;by
observations made on this disease, it appears that those
who are once afflicted with it, especially in so high a degree
as that squadron was, are more subject to it afterwards
than others.&rdquo; It is difficult at the present day to
express a personal opinion on this matter, as clinical
experience is meagre and the scurvy of guinea-pigs is so
acute that it cannot be used for comparison. Some of the
recurrences have been due probably to the fact that the
patient had not been completely cured of his first attack.
We have met with two cases of recurrences in infants, one
of which is of particular interest as it happened in spite
of giving lemon juice in the intervening period. The history
was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In September, 1914, one month after the baby was
admitted to the institution, it developed scurvy of a moderate
grade. It was then six months of age and weighed
10&frac14; pounds. It was put on a simple mixture containing
from 24 to 30 ounces of pasteurized milk and was given
in addition &frac12; ounce of lemon juice a day. It improved,
but during the winter had bronchitis, otitis, enteritis, and<span class="pagenum" title="229"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span>
later furunculosis. In spite of the fact that it had been
receiving an antiscorbutic for almost this entire period,
it developed scurvy once more in February, at the age
of 11 months, and when it weighed 14&frac12; pounds. It was
evident that this baby was peculiarly susceptible to
scurvy. It may be added that the second attack was
complicated by nasal diphtheria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this connection attention should be drawn to a
peculiar and puzzling clinical phenomenon, which we have
noted several times. Even if the antiscorbutic treatment
is carried out incompletely and only for a short period,
recrudescences may not take place. We have seen cases
where orange juice was given for merely ten days or two
weeks&mdash;that is, only until all scorbutic signs had disappeared,&mdash;and
yet the scurvy did not return, the infants
thrived for months thereafter, but were merely somewhat
pale and undernourished. In the case of two babies
which we have in mind, the diet remained absolutely unchanged,
with the exception of the short period of antiscorbutic
treatment, but this seemed sufficient to bring
about a diminished susceptibility.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum" title="230"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span></p>
<h2><span class="fs85">CHAPTER IX</span><br />
TREATMENT</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Seek the cure of scurvy neither in the armamentarium
of the physician nor in the apothecary shops. The
druggist will be of as little aid to you as the art of the
surgeon. On the other hand, employ fresh vegetables,
the juice of fresh antiscorbutic plants, oranges and lemons
or the juice of those fruits preserved with sugar; in
this way without other means you will be able to overcome
this terrible disease.&rdquo; This reads like the advice
of some modern therapeutist; it is, however, the conclusion
of a physician (Kramer) who wrote on scurvy almost
two hundred years ago, and shows that the treatment of
scurvy has undergone no fundamental change in the intervening
years. Our resources, however, have been amplified
by an increased knowledge of the relative value of
antiscorbutic foodstuffs and by the introduction of some
new ones.</p>

<p><b>Prevention.</b>&mdash;In the Temperate Zone, under ordinary
conditions, the adult population consumes sufficient antiscorbutic
foodstuff to protect it from scurvy. Under exceptional
circumstances, however&mdash;for example, when the
potato crop fails, or, in the case of individuals, when the
diet has been unduly restricted, scurvy will be encountered.
This disorder is still an important problem, however,
in relation to the health of adults in the Tropics,
in military expeditions and in Polar explorations. From
what has been stated in the preceding chapter, it is evident
that, at the present time, no reliance can be placed
on dehydrated vegetables as a protective agent. The<span class="pagenum" title="231"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></span>
recent suggestion of using germinated dried pulses and
seeds, under circumstances where fresh food is not available,
is practical and probably will be resorted to in the
future. To this end the pulses (beans, peas, lentils) are
soaked in water for 24 hours, and then kept moist with
access of air for about 48 hours at room temperature.
During this period they sprout and develop small radicles.
They are cooked in the usual way and have been found to
possess an antiscorbutic value comparable to that of most
vegetables. An individual should receive about four
ounces a day of these sprouted seeds. In the treatment of
some Serbian soldiers suffering from scurvy, Wiltshire
found that this amount of germinated beans brought about
a cure. There are, however, two drawbacks to their general
use. The prolonged cooking necessary for their
preparation reduces their antiscorbutic potency, and they
have been found indigestible when consumed in sufficient
quantity.</p>

<p>Under similar conditions canned tomatoes can be employed;
they have the disadvantage of greater bulk, but
are a more potent antiscorbutic, require no preparation
whatsoever, and are readily digested. They form part of
the present ration of the United States Army, in which
they can be given &ldquo;in lieu of an equal quantity of potatoes
not exceeding twenty per cent. of the total issue.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
The necessity of including an antiscorbutic in the army
ration has been recognized only in recent years; during
our Civil War and for thirty years thereafter there was<span class="pagenum" title="232"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></span>
no such provision. It was stated at that time that a
general scorbutic taint pervaded the troops&mdash;a mere
euphemism for the widespread existence of subacute or
latent scurvy. Even to-day the ration of the French and
of the Italian armies makes no definite provision in this
regard and the Russians provide merely for a variable
quantity of vegetables.</p>

<p>Recently it has been shown that lemon and orange
juices (Givens and McClugage) can be dried and still
preserve their antiscorbutic value. It is quite possible
that concentrated preparations of this kind will be serviceable
for army use and in regions where fresh fruit or
vegetables cannot be obtained.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Lind makes numerous ingenious suggestions for preparing
antiscorbutic remedies (Lind, pp. 7, 8 and 9) which
have a practical as well as historic interest. (Appendix
1.) One of these includes a formula for the preparation
of orange and lemon juice which may be preserved
for years; another gives a method for the preservation of
berries and other fruits which are to be picked when
partly ripe and put up in earthen pots; still another gives
the recipe for preparing a simple decoction of fir tops,
which was found by the Swedes efficacious in preventing
the development of scurvy among their soldiers. It is
interesting that a similar practice was resorted to in
Vienna during the recent war and recommended as a
prophylactic for scurvy in children (Tobler).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="233"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a></span></p>
<p><i>The prevention of infantile scurvy</i>, especially in its
rudimentary form, is of great practical importance, because
of its frequent occurrence. There is no question
but that breast milk and raw cow&rsquo;s milk furnish sufficient
antiscorbutic vitamine, but there is a difference of opinion
as to whether pasteurized milk, or milk that has been
brought just to the boiling-point, or even sterilized milk,
is adequate in this respect. Much of this divergence of
opinion is due to the fact that the various clinicians have
not considered or stated the quantity of milk which they
have found sufficient to protect, and also because milk
itself differs in its antiscorbutic value according to its
freshness and probably also according to the fodder of
the cows.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> Without entering once more into a discussion
of this question, it may be stated that unless the cow&rsquo;s
milk is raw, the infant should receive additional antiscorbutic
foodstuff. Moreover, this supplement to the dietary
should be made as soon as possible, so as not to
allow the vitamine deficiency and inadequate diet to exist
for even a short period. In our experience there is no
contra-indication to the giving of orange juice or of
strained canned tomato, the two antiscorbutics with which
we have had a large experience, to babies one month of
age or even younger. The common practice, however,
is to wait until the infant is five or six months of age, which<span class="pagenum" title="234"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></span>
certainly must allow a rudimentary scorbutic condition to
develop. At the age of a month one teaspoonful of orange
juice may be given; it should be diluted with water and
sugar added if it is tart. This may be administered notwithstanding
the fact that a baby has a tendency to looseness
of the bowels, as orange juice, as recently pointed
out by Gerstenberger, has practically no laxative action.
Occasionally babies regurgitate orange juice, but the reaction
usually ceases after a day or two. If it does not, a
small amount of an alkali&mdash;for example, limewater or
sodium bicarbonate&mdash;may be added just previous to feeding;
in this state the juice will be better tolerated.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> The
amount of orange juice should be increased so that
when the baby is three months of age it receives
one tablespoonful.</p>

<p>A few years ago Hess and Fish recommended the use
of an infusion of orange peel in infant feeding. The peel
was finely grated, soaked overnight in water (1 ounce
of the peel to 2 ounces of water), and a small amount of
sugar added to this liquid. Animal experiments showed
that this preparation possessed decided antiscorbutic
value. This decoction may well be used for the sake of
economy, and even when the orange juice is employed the
infusion of the peel may be added.</p>

<p>An antiscorbutic which vies with orange or with lemon
juice in adaptability for infant feeding is <i>canned tomatoes</i>,
as recently suggested by Hess and Unger. Tomatoes are
not in good repute among food experts in view of the
small amount of calories which they contain&mdash;only about<span class="pagenum" title="235"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span>
100 to the pound&mdash;and are regarded with suspicion
amounting almost to superstition by mothers and nurses
as a food for children. In spite of this fact, it may be
stated without hesitation that they are fully as well borne
by infants a few weeks or months of age as orange or
lemon juice. In considering antiscorbutics, it has been
shown that notwithstanding the canning process and
subsequent aging, they preserve their potency. The dose
is two tablespoonfuls for babies over three months of age.
The tomatoes are merely strained through a colander and
warmed (not cooked). To illustrate their innocuous character,
it may be added that as much as 6 and 8 ounces
a day of this juice have been given to a baby under one
year of age without producing untoward symptoms. This
antiscorbutic should have wide applicability, especially
in the United States.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>Another antiscorbutic which can be used in a routine
way to prevent infantile scurvy is <i>swede juice</i>, prepared
by grating the raw vegetable and squeezing the pulp in
muslin. Chick and Rhodes report that this juice has
been adopted for use in some of the English infant-welfare
centres. It should be given in about the same
dosage as the tomatoes, and seems applicable where the
swede can be readily obtained.</p>

<p>For babies over six months of age, reliance may be
placed on the ordinary household vegetables&mdash;potatoes,
spinach, carrots, squash, etc. Attention should be paid
to the amount which is taken, as one or two teaspoonfuls
of a vegetable which is poor in antiscorbutic power, such<span class="pagenum" title="236"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
as carrots or beets, will be insufficient to protect against
scurvy. Especially is this true if the vegetables are old
and stale and are cooked for a long period;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> some years
ago two infants under our care developed scurvy in spite
of a small daily ration of vegetables.</p>

<p>Potato in the amounts usually consumed is a valuable
antiscorbutic. It is not an exaggeration to state that it
is the main antiscorbutic bulwark of man. In giving
baked potato to children it is commonly advised to use
the floury part just beneath the peel; this should be put
through a sieve and mixed thoroughly with boiled milk
so as to constitute a cream; for younger babies it can be
prepared with water to form a diluent similar to the
barley water so commonly employed to dilute cow&rsquo;s milk
(1 tablespoonful of potato to a pint of milk, cooked for
15 minutes). Little reliance should be placed on beef
juice in the usual dosage and none on eggs.</p>

<p><b>Cure.</b>&mdash;There is almost nothing in the realm of therapy
which is so striking as a scorbutic patient&rsquo;s prompt reaction
to antiscorbutic treatment. It is all the more marvelous
as the cure is effected by means of foodstuffs with
which we are accustomed to associate no specific virtue.
A magic result is seen frequently within 24 or 48 hours.
A baby which has had a poor appetite, has been irritable
and exquisitely tender, suddenly regains its appetite, is no
longer fretful, and can be handled without occasioning
crying. Within a week, if the case is mild, all definite
symptoms of scurvy may have disappeared, and soon
thereafter the infant is thriving and apparently cured.

<p>In most instances a gain of weight accompanies improvement.
In not a few instances, however, there is a temporary
loss or cessation of weight, due in part to an
increased excretion of urine. Occasionally there is observed
a short exacerbation of the symptoms following
the giving of an antiscorbutic&mdash;a swelling of the thigh
or hemorrhage of the gums. A similar phenomenon has
been noted in relation to the treatment of polyneuritis
in birds and of beriberi in man.</p>

<p>In the cure of scurvy the same dietetic remedies are
employed as in its prevention. Orange juice is the sovereign
remedy, and should be given in a dosage of about
2 ounces a day.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Canned tomato is also most efficacious.
If these changes in the dietary are carried out, it is not
absolutely necessary to alter the food, although it is
advisable to do so. Some writers, for example Neumann<span class="pagenum" title="238"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span>
and Czerny, treat the disorder by giving milk which has
been scalded or brought to the boiling-point. Others lay
particular stress on changing the source of the milk supply,
believing that the sameness of the diet leads to the
occurrence of scurvy. Such, however, cannot be the case,
as otherwise breast-fed babies would be highly subject
to this disease. In the report of the American Pediatric
Society one case developed on condensed milk and was
cured by sterilized milk, and another developed on pasteurized
milk and was cured by sterilized milk and broths.
These results are explicable; large amounts of milk were
given to effect the cure. It may be said in general that
in addition to giving fruit or vegetable juices the milk
should be either raw or heated to as low a degree as possible
(duration of heating as well as height of temperature).
Furthermore, the antiscorbutic treatment should
be continued for a period of months, as the clinical improvement
far outstrips the restoration of the bones and
other tissues. It seems necessary again to call attention
to the fact that too great reliance has been placed on the
use of beef juice, which has been shown, both in experiment
and in the clinic, to possess comparatively weak
antiscorbutic properties.</p>

<p>Orange juice may be given intravenously. This method
may be resorted to where the patient is in an advanced
stage of the disease or where food cannot be tolerated by
mouth; for example, in cases such as that mentioned by
Cheadle, where death took place owing to the fact that
the antiscorbutic could be taken only sparingly, on account
of the extreme prostration of the patient. For this
purpose the orange juice is obtained in as sterile a manner
as possible, boiled for about five minutes and is rendered
neutral or slightly alkaline just previous to its injection<span class="pagenum" title="239"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span>
by the addition of normal sodium hydroxide. Hess and
Unger report three cases where this procedure was carried
out without the slightest untoward reaction. In one
instance, improvement was noted 16 hours after the injection.
In view of the novelty of this treatment it may
be of interest to cite a case:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A baby 16 months old had hemorrhage of the gums
and tenderness of the legs, which were held in the characteristic
flexed and everted position. Eliminative treatment
was tried without avail; Dover&rsquo;s powder and
warmth to promote perspiration; caffeine to promote
diuresis; and 2 tablespoonfuls of liquid petrolatum three
times a day to increase elimination from the bowels. Intravenous
injections of salt solution also proved of
no value.</p>

<p>Four intravenous injections of orange juice were given&mdash;6 c.c.,
12 c.c., 6 c.c., and 35 c.c. As was stated, improvement
was noted 16 hours after the first injection. The
infant was less irritable, the gums no longer hemorrhagic,
and the &ldquo;capillary resistance test&rdquo; (that is to say, the development
of petechial spots on the forearm when a
tourniquet was applied for 3 minutes to the upper arm)
changed from positive to negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harden, Zilva and Still have recommended the use of a
concentrated lemon juice for the cure of scurvy, constituting
a form of &ldquo;intensive&rdquo; treatment. In four cases this
proved to be of clinical value. Freise has made use of an
alcoholic extract of turnips, and Freudenberg of a similar
extract of carrots. These preparations did not seem to
be markedly potent, and therefore possess no particular
therapeutic advantages.</p>

<p><b>Non-dietetic Therapy.</b>&mdash;There is little to be done for
the patient in addition to the giving of sufficient antiscorbutic.<span class="pagenum" title="240"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span>
No one has reported success with any drug. We
have tried the use of atropin, adrenalin, thyroid and
parathyroid extracts, cod liver oil, autolyzed yeast, lactose,
sodium chloride, calcium chloride, etc., without noting
any improvement. Mercurials are stated to be
positively harmful, especially when ulcers are present.
The patient should be kept in bed, and exertion not
allowed on account of the involvement of the heart, which
has led to sudden collapse and death. The gums may be
treated with nitrate of silver stick or tincture of myrrh.
If there is fracture of the long bones with displacement,
splints should be applied. Under no circumstances should
hemorrhagic effusions in or about the joints be incised.
The patient should be placed in a room which is well
aired and lighted, and should be handled and dressed as
infrequently as possible, so as to avoid discomfort and
pain. It is particularly important that intercurrent infections
should be avoided by shielding patients from
contact with those who have infectious diseases, especially
respiratory infections.</p>

<h2><span class="fs85">CHAPTER X</span><br />
METABOLISM</h2>


<p>Studies of the chemical exchanges in scurvy have been
surprisingly few. It is a field that should repay investigation,
promising to afford a clearer insight into the
intermediary metabolism in this disorder. One of the
first to touch upon this question was Garrod, who in 1848
reported that there was a diminution of potassium salts
in the urine and in the blood of scurvy patients. In 1877
Ralfe confirmed the potassium deficiency in the urine, but
denied its importance from an etiologic standpoint, as he
was unable to benefit scurvy patients by administering
potassium nitrate. He reported an increase of uric acid
in the urine, a diminution of the total acidity, and a reduction
of the alkaline phosphates. Litten found the analyses
of the urine very contradictory in respect to potassium,
but stated that beyond a doubt its uric acid content is
increased at the height of the disease, although this diminishes
rapidly with convalescence. These few and scattered
articles comprise the sum of metabolic studies up
to the last decade, and even during the succeeding period
they have been very few&mdash;so few, indeed, that they furnish
insufficient data from which to draw conclusions.</p>

<p>The first careful study of the mineral metabolism in
a case of scurvy is that of Baumann and Howard, published
in 1912. Its conclusions are not very definite.
They may be summed up by their statement that &ldquo;chlorin
and sodium were retained during the fruit-juice period,
but excreted in excess of the intake during the preliminary
period,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;more potassium, calcium and<span class="pagenum" title="242"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span>
magnesium were retained during the fruit-juice period.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This same year Lust and Klocman published the first
metabolism study of a case of infantile scurvy. The baby
was 18 months old and the metabolic changes were investigated
during the active, convalescent, and &ldquo;the healing
stage&rdquo; of the disorder. This study seems to have been
carefully carried out. The fact, however, that the infant
received 800 c.c. daily of slightly-boiled milk during the
active stage, and was improving at this time, may also
have had a beneficial effect on the metabolism in respect
to scurvy. The results of these writers are surprising&mdash;quite
different from what they expected or what we should
have expected. They write: &ldquo;The balance of the mineral
metabolism, including the total ash, the calcium, phosphorus
and chlorin during the florid stage of the disease
must be regarded not only as not damaged, compared to
that of the healthy child, but indeed as somewhat increased.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All the more striking, on the contrary, are
the results found during the stage of convalescence. Here
the balances were all markedly negative, and only after a
lapse of weeks was the tendency manifested to a return
to normal conditions.&rdquo; The authors regard these results
as indicating a sort of washing out of &ldquo;dead material&rdquo;
during convalescence&mdash;of material which had gathered
during the florid stage of the disease. According to their
interpretation the disease is due, not to a primary or
secondary salt deficiency, but to a disturbance in salt
elimination, and in the first place, of a calcium excretion.
This is shown by the fact that even in the &ldquo;stage of healing,&rdquo;
when the total ash and the phosphorus balance once
more had become positive, the calcium balance nevertheless
remained somewhat negative. The metabolism of
infantile scurvy, they believe, far from showing a resemblance<span class="pagenum" title="243"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>
to rickets, manifests quite the contrary tendency.
The study of this case of infantile scurvy and that of
Baumann and Howard of a case of adult scurvy, comprise
the total investigation of the metabolism in
human scurvy.</p>

<p>In the course of a recent discussion on rickets before
the Medical Society of Vienna, Moll states briefly that in
a case of infantile scurvy, at the height of the disease, he
found a positive calcium balance, which became poor and
later negative on giving fruit juice; in other words, a
partial confirmation of the work which has just been cited.</p>

<p>In 1913 Bahrdt and Edelstein reported the analyses of
the organs of an infant almost nine months old who died
of scurvy; an examination of the tissues, especially
of the bones, should be most valuable in checking up
determinations of the metabolism during life. This investigation
runs absolutely contrary to that of Lust and
Klocman. The bones showed a decrease of ash, especially
of calcium and of phosphorus, and also a lack of calcium
in the muscles, but normal amounts in the liver and in the
kidneys. These conditions resemble the deficiency of ash
and of lime commonly associated with rickets, and it seems
quite possible that this infant had rickets as well as scurvy,
and that in this way the discrepancy between the two
reports is to be explained. The fact that the water content
of the bones was two to three times the normal,
also lends emphasis to this interpretation. <i>In any metabolism
study of infantile scurvy, great care will have to be
exercised that the disorder is not complicated by rickets</i>,
and the issue thereby confused. It will be very difficult
to avoid this pitfall, for there is no test by which early
rickets can be diagnosed. The danger of this complication
may be realized when we bear in mind that the majority<span class="pagenum" title="244"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span>
of infants have rickets to some degree. An investigation
of the chemistry of adult scurvy has an advantage from
this point of view.</p>

<p>Chemical examination of the blood has yielded such
valuable information regarding metabolic diseases, that it
might be expected to shed light on the disturbances of
scurvy. The only investigation from this standpoint is
that of Hess and Killian, who have reported estimations
of the urea, creatinine, sugar, CO<sub><span class="fs65">2</span></sub> combining power, diastase,
cholesterol, chlorine and calcium.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> The urea content
was normal, varying between 12 and 14 mg. per
100 c.c. of blood; this is the average of twenty-one tests
on ten cases of infantile scurvy. (In severe cases of
beriberi Yano and Nemoti have recently reported that
the blood contains an increase of urea, and that its excretion
is frequently disturbed.) The creatinine was estimated
in two cases and was found to be 2.0 mg. and 1.7 mg.
per cent., respectively,&mdash;also normal figures. The blood
sugar varied from 0.12 to 0.14 per cent. and was examined
in almost all the cases in which urea was estimated; these
figures are at the upper level of normality (no attention
was paid to the interval elapsing between the feeding and
the withdrawal of the blood). The diastatic activity was
likewise normal. The CO<sub><span class="fs65">2</span></sub> combining power showed figures
under 40 to 45, according to the Van Slyke method,
and indicated therefore a mild degree of acidosis. In six
cases the chlorides were estimated, the figures being remarkably
constant at about 0.42 or 0.43. Cholesterol was a
little below normal in the four cases examined. Contradictory
results were obtained in regard to calcium. Earlier
tests showed a definite deficiency of this salt, but those<span class="pagenum" title="245"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></span>
carried out more recently have generally yielded normal
results. Further studies of the blood calcium are
highly desirable to ascertain whether it varies in amount
in the circulation, and especially in different stages of the
disease. This aspect is worthy of particular attention
in view of the positive calcium balance noted by Lust and
Klocman during the active stage of scurvy, and the negative
balance during the period of convalescence.</p>

<p>It is evident from the limited data concerning the blood
chemistry of scurvy that it is a field which has been inadequately
explored and will repay more intensive study.
Investigations of this kind have recently been made possible
by the introduction of accurate methods requiring
only small quantities of blood.</p>

<p>Studies of the metabolism of animals suffering from
scurvy are almost as few as those on man. The work of
Morgan and Beger, which is frequently quoted in this
connection, is not applicable, as it concerns rabbits, which
do not develop scurvy. They found that rabbits fed solely
on oats and water suffered in their nutrition (loss of appetite,
emaciation, paralysis of hind legs), and could be
cured by the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the dietary.
In 1916 Lewis and Karr published a paper on the constituents
of the blood and the tissues of guinea-pigs fed
on an exclusive oat diet. They found the urea content
several times greater than normal, but that it fell to normal
once more if cabbage or orange juice was given.
From the standpoint of scurvy, this investigation is open
to the criticism that the diet was too incomplete, and also,
as the authors suggest, that the animals suffered from
partial starvation and a lack of water.</p>

<p>In the following year Karr and Lewis published a
paper on a different phase of this subject, and came to the<span class="pagenum" title="246"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span>
following conclusions: &ldquo;No changes in urinary elimination
of phenols, nor in the degree of conjugation of the
phenols, were observed, provided the factor of partial
starvation was ruled out. This is believed to indicate
that no increased bacterial action occurs in the intestine
of scorbutic guinea-pigs despite the difficulty of evacuation
of the fæces.&rdquo; These results are in harmony with
the bacteriological study of Torrey and Hess, who found
that there was no increase in the proteolytic flora of
the intestine in infants or in guinea-pigs suffering
from scurvy.</p>

<p>In 1917 <ins title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: originally Bauman">Baumann</ins> and Howard published the only metabolism
study which has been carried out on guinea-pigs
suffering from scurvy, and they are of the opinion that
this disorder has a profound effect on the mineral metabolism
of this animal. The calcium was excreted in notably
large amount; potassium was also lost, and to a
greater extent than sodium; the only element which was
consistently retained during the active stage as well
as during the period of recovery, was magnesium. This
study was followed shortly by one from the same laboratory,
by Howard and Ingvaldsen, carried out on a monkey
suffering from scurvy. It was inconclusive, not conforming
to the experiments on the guinea-pigs; the authors
state that the &ldquo;changes in the mineral excretion of the
monkey during the scorbutic period were not sufficiently
significant to admit of easy interpretation.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
marked loss of the various mineral substances encountered
in experiments with man and guinea-pig was not
observed in the present series.&rdquo; It should be remembered,
however, that the diets of the guinea-pigs and the
monkeys were quite different, the former consisting
mainly of oats, and the latter of condensed milk. It is<span class="pagenum" title="247"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span>
quite possible that the basic diet may play a rôle in the
metabolism of this disease, although, as stated elsewhere,
its effect cannot be noted clinically. Special attention
should be paid to this factor in metabolic studies, in view
of the widely-held opinion that the carbohydrates exert
a potent influence in the development of beriberi.</p>

<p>The investigations of the nitrogen metabolism in man
and in animals have been most unsatisfactory. The two
on human beings&mdash;an infant and an adult&mdash;were negative;
that on guinea-pig scurvy cannot be utilized on
account of the restricted diet of oats, which contained
insufficient nitrogen, whereas the one on the monkey
showed some loss of nitrogen, which led the authors
to suggest an increased nitrogenous catabolism in scurvy.
This comprises the total data on this subject.</p>

<p>Summarizing the results of these few metabolic
studies, it may be stated that they harmonize on one
point only&mdash;the positive balance of calcium during the
active stage of the disease. The investigation of <ins title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: originally Bauman">Baumann</ins>
and Howard on adult scurvy, of Lust and Klocman
and of Moll on infantile scurvy, and of Howard and
Ingvaldsen on the monkey, are all in agreement in this
important conclusion.</p>

<h2><span class="fs85">CHAPTER XI</span><br />
RELATION OF SCURVY TO OTHER DISEASES</h2>


<p>In the foregoing there has been frequent reference
to the close relationship between scurvy and the incidence
of the infectious diseases&mdash;to the fact that a scorbutic
condition increases the susceptibility to infection. This is
indeed one of the most characteristic, as well as one of the
most important phenomena associated with scurvy and
other disorders resulting from vitamine deficiency. Mention
has been made of the special susceptibility to the
diphtheria bacillus, and to the organisms leading to coryza
and the respiratory diseases, but no doubt this applies
also to invasion by other bacteria. We wish, however,
to confine ourselves to the nutritional disorders, first in
their relationship one to the other, and second, as a group
of deficiency diseases, due to a lack of vitamines of various
kinds. As is well known, in addition to scurvy, this group
generally includes beriberi, a disease attributed to a lack
of the water-soluble vitamine, and xerophthalmia, an
eye condition which recently has been brought about in
rats by placing them on a diet free from fat-soluble vitamine.
These, however, form only the nucleus of the disorders
which commonly are included in this category.
Schaumann, the first to formulate this classification, illustrated
his conception of the interrelationship by depicting
the various members as spokes of a wheel surrounding
a central hub. He included scurvy, rickets, osteomalacia,
typical beriberi, ship-beriberi, pellagra and mehlnaerschaden.
Funk made a similar classification of disorders
which he termed the &ldquo;avitaminosen.&rdquo; There is<span class="pagenum" title="249"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></span>
a tendency to enlarge rather than to decrease the membership
of this class, and recently war or hunger edema,
infantile atrophy and diarrh&oelig;a, sprue, c&oelig;liac disease,
leprosy and others have been proposed as suitable candidates.
At the present time it is impossible to determine
which and how many of this motley company should be
associated with scurvy. Some, possibly, are the result
of a lack of vitamine, but for the present it will be well
to bear in mind that three vitamines only have stood the
test of experiment, and only these three therefore can be
definitely connected in a causal relationship with pathologic
conditions. In addition to this consideration of the
interrelationship of the &ldquo;deficiency diseases,&rdquo; the kinship
of allied disorders&mdash;more particularly of rickets&mdash;must
be discussed.</p>

<p>Although at first thought <i>beriberi</i> and scurvy would
seem far apart from a clinical point of view, they have
some important features in common. In both there is a
tendency to a rapidity of the heart&rsquo;s action and a marked
lability of the pulse, to an enlargement of the cardiac
ventricles, to an involvement of the vagus, and to an
exaggeration of the deep reflexes. It is unnecessary to
describe these signs and symptoms in detail, as they have
been fully considered under symptomatology. It has been
recorded from time to time that under certain circumstances
scurvy has developed in man where one should
have expected beriberi, and <i>vice versa</i>. Darling, who has
had a large experience in this field, writes: &ldquo;A deficient
dietary in a tropical African negro mine laborer causes
severe scurvy, in a Cape Colony African mine laborer,
mild scurvy, and in some African negroes a diet that
causes scurvy in one set of men causes neuritis in others.&rdquo;
Possibly some minor differences in the dietary can explain<span class="pagenum" title="250"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a></span>
this difference in reaction&mdash;for we do not know all
the sources of the water-soluble vitamine, but such an
experience deserves to be cited as it is not an isolated
instance. It is all the more worthy of attention because
it harmonizes to a certain extent with the everyday experience
of animal investigation. As has been stated elsewhere,
a diet of decorticated grain will lead to scurvy in
the guinea-pig, to polyneuritis in the pigeon, and to a
combination of these diseases in the hog! Results of this
kind show that there must be a relationship between the
etiologic factors of scurvy and of beriberi. It is unwise
at present to attempt to define the relationship more
precisely. The remarkable observation, first made by
Fuerst, and since confirmed by numerous investigators,
that seeds and legumes are devoid of antiscorbutic potency
but acquire this power on sprouting, constitutes another
link in the evidence of their kinship. Funk has suggested
that the antiscorbutic vitamine can be formed from the
&ldquo;antineuritic&rdquo; vitamine, a theory which is very attractive
but needs confirmation and experimental proof. It
is quite evident that this change does not usually occur
in animals, in view of the specificity of the vitamines for
their respective diseases&mdash;of the antiscorbutic for scurvy
and the water-soluble for beriberi.</p>

<p>It will be noted that &ldquo;<i>ship-beriberi</i>&rdquo; is included in
this group of diseases. Very little is known about this
condition, except what is contained in the investigation
of Nocht (1903) and that of Holst and Froelich. It is a
very rare condition but of interest because it is characterized
by spongy, hemorrhagic gums and other signs
encountered in scurvy. The feature which differentiates
it sharply from scurvy, however, is an anæsthesia of the
extremities. Ship-beriberi is generally regarded as a<span class="pagenum" title="251"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a></span>
combination of beriberi and scurvy. Where these two disorders
occur concomitantly, the beriberi manifests itself
some months before the scurvy, as the latter takes much
longer to develop.</p>

<p>In considering the vitamines in connection with diseases
of the nervous system, mention may be made of
&ldquo;central neuritis&rdquo; and the &ldquo;peripheral neuritis&rdquo; which
has been reported from the West Indies. This bears only
a partial resemblance to beriberi, as there is no edema,
nor dyspn&oelig;a, and its course is more chronic. Judging
from the report of Edwards from Jamaica, the cases more
closely resemble pellagra, terminating after many years.
A degeneration of the cells of the spinal cord was found
and &ldquo;in some isolated patches of the cerebellum and in
the roots of the optic and auditory nerves.&rdquo; The disease
occurs among the poor classes whose diet is inadequate
chiefly in nitrogen.</p>

<p>Eijkman was the first to draw an analogy between
beriberi and <i>pellagra</i>, and thus to suggest that the latter
might be a disease due to an unidentified factor; he compared
the pernicious effect of a diet of polished rice with
that of decorticated corn. Of recent years, largely as the
result of the investigations of Goldberger and his co-workers,
pellagra has come to be regarded as a dietetic
disorder primarily due to a lack of adequate protein,
rather than to a lack of a specific vitamine. Its relationship
to scurvy cannot, therefore, at the present time, be
discussed from an etiologic viewpoint. Apart, however,
from the question of etiology, the two diseases have certain
clinical symptoms in common. Weston states that
&ldquo;distinguished physicians, who were really astute observers,
have mistaken pellagra for scurvy, eczema,
various kinds of intestinal troubles, syphilis, and many<span class="pagenum" title="252"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a></span>
other diseases.&rdquo; In the chapter on symptomatology,
attention has been directed to the fact that an eczema
which yields to antiscorbutic treatment may occur in
scurvy; at times it presents the symmetrical arrangement
so typical of pellagra. In other cases a fleeting erythema
may be observed, another sign noted frequently in pellagrins.
In some instances congestion of the gums has
been recorded. In describing a little girl of three who
had pellagra, Weston writes: &ldquo;The gums are also red
and swollen, suggesting scurvy.&rdquo; This child had eaten
large amounts of turnips, so that there could have been
no question of complicating scurvy. Lombroso and some
of the earlier authors drew attention to the fact that
fragility of the bones, of the ribs and of the long bones,
was often associated with pellagra. These various clinical
similarities should not be construed as evidence in
favor of the &ldquo;avitamine&rdquo; nature of pellagra. They indicate,
rather, that in nutritional disorders, whatever may
be their underlying cause, the vessels, the bones, and other
tissues may suffer and lead to similar&mdash;but not identical&mdash;clinical
pictures.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>The relation between scurvy and rickets is a subject
which was discussed by Glisson. With the renewed interest
in infantile scurvy which followed Barlow&rsquo;s work
toward the end of the last century, children&rsquo;s specialists
ranged themselves into opposing camps on the question
of the interrelationship and interdependency of these two<span class="pagenum" title="253"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></span>
diseases. Some accepted Barlow&rsquo;s dictum that infantile
scurvy is an absolutely distinct and separate entity;
others, for example, Hirschsprung, declared that the so-called
scurvy was merely a form of rickets; whereas a
third group considered it a combination of rickets and
scurvy. This last viewpoint was actively maintained by
Cheadle on the clinical side, and later by Schoedel and
Nauwerk on the pathologic side&mdash;the latter declaring that
rickets is &ldquo;an inseparable component of infantile scurvy,&rdquo;
and that the entire disease should be regarded merely
as &ldquo;an episode in the course of rickets.&rdquo; Even Barlow,
in a paper published in 1894, wrote: &ldquo;Rhachitic changes
already present may act as a physiological determinant
of the sites in which scurvy becomes manifest&rdquo; and
&ldquo;rickets as a basis plus inadequate food gives the simplest
explanation of the typical case&rdquo; (of scurvy).</p>

<p>We had an exceptional opportunity to test this thesis
in 1914, in an institution where scurvy broke out among
infants who were on a diet of pasteurized milk. All these
infants were receiving cod liver oil daily, as prophylactic
treatment against rickets. Many infants have been seen
since that time, who in spite of receiving cod liver oil
developed scurvy, and others in whom large doses of
this oil failed to mitigate the scurvy, although it prevented
rickets. The same failure has been encountered
in the treatment of scurvy in guinea-pigs. This experience
has been without exception, both from a prophylactic
and a curative standpoint.</p>

<p>Confusion between the two diseases has resulted from
the fact that the majority of infants in the Temperate
Zone have some degree of rickets. Thus the two diseases
have been found very frequently associated in pathologic
examination of the bones, leading some to infer that they
are in some way interdependent. They have been also<span class="pagenum" title="254"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a></span>
confused clinically, as mentioned in another connection,
owing to the fact that beading of the ribs&mdash;the rhachitic
rosary&mdash;has been mistakenly regarded as a pathognomonic
sign of rickets, whereas it is also a sign common to scurvy.
It is important to bear in mind that from the pathologic
viewpoint scurvy and rickets present strikingly dissimilar
pictures&mdash;the former is characterized by an almost complete
cessation of activity of bone-forming elements,
whereas the latter is distinguished by a hyperplastic condition
leading to a marked overgrowth of cartilage and
of abnormal bone. Viewed from the pathologic, etiologic
and clinical standpoint, we believe that there is no basis
for assuming an interrelationship between the two disorders,
and that scurvy will develop as readily and as
rapidly where rickets is absent as where it is present.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>It is premature to discuss the relationship of these two
disorders from the vitamine standpoint. In 1910
Schaumann suggested that rickets was due to a lack of
a specific food factor, and somewhat later Funk included
it among the &ldquo;avitaminosen.&rdquo; Recently Mellanby, as
the result of experiments on dogs, has affirmed that the
fault lies in a lack of the fat-soluble or a closely-related
vitamine. Investigations of the near future will probably
decide the merits of this contention; our experience is that
rickets develops in infants even where the diet contains
adequate fat-soluble vitamine. If rickets is proved to
be a disorder depending on a vitamine, it belongs, naturally,<span class="pagenum" title="255"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a></span>
in the same group as scurvy. This would indicate
relationship, but not interrelationship. Just as the mere
fact that a lack of vitamines leads to scurvy and to beriberi
does not signify, in theory or in practice, the existence
of pathogenetic interrelationship. However, as
stated, this is a subject which does not as yet rest on a
secure foundation.</p>

<p><i>Osteogenesis imperfecta and osteomalacia</i> are disorders
of dietetic or metabolic origin characterized by
fragility of the bones. The latter has developed new significance
and importance due to its increased occurrence
in almost epidemic form in the Central Empires at the
close of the World War. The etiology of both disorders is
most obscure. In the future in considering their pathogenesis
it will be well to draw a sharp distinction between
them. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a disease in which an
injury occurs to the f&oelig;tus without any manifest illness in
the mother, which seems to indicate a primary lesion of the
f&oelig;tus (perhaps metabolic); osteomalacia, on the other
hand, attacks the mother who gives birth to an apparently
healthy f&oelig;tus. The latter gains added interest because
it is a disease of the bones which is attributed to dysfunction
of the endocrine glands, to a disturbance especially
of the parathyroid. If this observation is confirmed,
it furnishes another anatomical basis for associating
the glands of internal secretion with pathologic conditions
of the bones.</p>

<p>One cannot survey the various diseases of the bones&mdash;scurvy,
rickets, osteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfecta,
osteomalacia, etc.,&mdash;without realizing that this group is at
present in a state of great confusion and will have to be
rearranged and winnowed. The differentiation between
some of these diseases is not in every instance clear morphologically&mdash;for<span class="pagenum" title="256"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></span>
instance, early cases of scurvy and
osteoporosis&mdash;so that it is difficult to consider them
satisfactorily from the standpoint of pathogenesis. Clinical
differentiation is still more difficult and uncertain. It
seems probable that new entities will be established, as
has happened in the past. It is not so long since rickets
included almost all the bone diseases of infants. Gradually
congenital syphilis, scurvy, and achondroplasia
were segregated as distinct diseases. Probably a similar
separation of other pathologic conditions, now so entangled
as to be indistinguishable, will be evolved.</p>

<p>Among the diseases which have been attributed to a
vitamine deficiency are &ldquo;war or hunger edema,&rdquo; sprue,
the &ldquo;mehlnaerschaden&rdquo; of infants, and the &ldquo;exudative
diathesis&rdquo; described by Czerny and Keller. Future investigation
will disclose whether any of these disorders
belong in the group with scurvy. The <i>hunger edema</i>,
noted in the late war and in previous wars, seems to be
a complex condition, quite dissociated from scurvy, as
many of the sufferers consumed comparatively large
quantities of potatoes or other vegetables. The &ldquo;<i>mehlnaerschaden</i>&rdquo;
resembles scurvy and the other vitamine
disorders in its tendency to produce hydremia and susceptibility
to infection. It also develops in spite of a
liberal supply of antiscorbutic foodstuff in the dietary.
As its name implies, it comes about on a diet containing
large quantities of carbohydrate, of the cereal paps so
commonly fed to infants. It is conceivable that an unbalanced
diet of this kind may not provide a sufficiency of
all the vitamines.</p>

<p>It does not seem probable that <i>exudative diathesis</i>, a
term which implies a predisposition to develop exudations
or denudations of the skin and mucous membranes, is the<span class="pagenum" title="257"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></span>
result of a lack of vitamine. This condition does, however,
predispose to scurvy. The association was very
evident in the group of cases reported by Hess and Fish
in 1914. It is not without significance that the blood-vessels
in exudative diathesis also show a decided weakness,
an increased permeability, as judged by the &ldquo;capillary
resistance test.&rdquo; In both scurvy and in exudative
diathesis eczema and petechial hemorrhages
are encountered.</p>

<p>There may be <i>nutritional diseases due to an excess of
food</i> rather than to a deficiency. A superfluity may be
harmful by hindering the proper utilization of the food,
or may possibly lead to the formation of deleterious products.
Disturbances of this kind do occur. For example,
it is by no means uncommon for an infant which has been
overfed with milk to show the typical signs of rickets.
Young guinea-pigs which are fed liberal amounts of cow&rsquo;s
milk develop a disease characterized by fragility of the
bones. The experience of Lubarsch, who produced osteogenesis
imperfecta in rabbits by means of a diet consisting
mainly of liver, or adrenal gland, is of interest,
especially as this condition did not come about when they
were fed muscle tissue.</p>

<p>From what has been stated, it must be evident that this
subject not only is in a state of flux but that it is in a
state of great confusion. This applies not only to the
relationship of vitamines to these disorders, but to their
identification and demarcation pathologically as well as
clinically. During the past few years we have begun
to regard these diseases from a new viewpoint, which no
doubt will be helpful, but it is probable that they will
not be sharply defined and their relationships determined
until it is possible to bring about each disease definitely<span class="pagenum" title="258"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a></span>
and regularly in an experimental animal. Until this time
we should proceed slowly, and not bring about &ldquo;confusion
worse confounded&rdquo; by yielding to the vogue, and
grouping together heterogeneous and little-understood
clinical conditions under the caption of deficiency diseases.
There is a growing danger of attributing every
unexplained nutritional disorder to the new, overworked,
but ill-defined vitamines&mdash;of their sharing with the secretions
of the endocrine glands the fate of becoming the
dumping-ground for every unidentified disorder.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>


<p>Extract from &ldquo;Treatise on Scurvy,&rdquo; by James Lind, London, 1772.</p>

<p>(a) <i>Recipe for preparing a stable orange or lemon juice.</i> Let the
squeezed juice of these fruits be well cleared from the pulp and purified by
standing for some time; then poured off from the gross sediment; or, to
have it still purer, it may be filtrated. Let it then be put into any clean
open vessel of china or stone-ware, which should be wider at the top than
bottom, so that there may be the largest surface above to favor the evaporation.
For this purpose a china basin or punch-bowl is proper, and generally
made in the form required; all earthen glazed vessels are unfit, as
their glazing will be dissolved by the acid. Into this pour the purified juice,
and put it into a pan of water, upon a clear fire. Let the water come almost
to a boil, and continue nearly in that state (with the basin containing the
juice in the middle of it) until the juice is found to be of the consistence of
a thick syrup when cold. The slower the evaporation of the juice the better;
and it will require at least twelve or fourteen hours continuance in
the bath heat before it is reduced to a proper consistence.</p>

<p>It is then, when cold, to be corked up in a bottle for use. Two dozen
good oranges, weighing five pounds four ounces, will yield one pound nine
ounces and a half of pure juice; and when evaporated, there will remain
about five ounces of rob, or extract; which in bulk will be equal to less than
three ounces of water. So that thus the acid, and the virtues of twelve
dozen lemons or oranges, may be put into a quart bottle, and preserved
for several years.</p>

<p>I have now some extract of lemons which was made four years ago.</p>

<p>Those who intend this extract for making punch may infuse some of the
fresh peel of the oranges or lemons into the spirit before it is used.</p>

<p>But for this purpose I find it is sufficient to add a very small quantity
of the outer peel to the extract a little before it is taken off the fire, and
there will be all that is requisite to make it entirely equal to the
freshest fruit.</p>

<p>(b) <i>How to preserve berries and other fruits for long periods.</i> And
it may be proper to acquaint them that most berries, and several fruits, when
gathered two-thirds ripe on a dry day, while the sun shines, if put into
earthen pots, or rather in dry bottles, well corked, and sealed up, so that
no air or moisture can enter, will keep a long time, and at the end of a year,
be as fresh as when new pulled.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Method of preparing an antiscorbutic decoction from fir-tops, leaves,
bark, etc.</i> <span class="pagenum" title="260"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a></span>When the Swedes carried on a war against the Muscovites, almost
all the soldiers of their army were destroyed by the scurvy, having putrid
gums, rigid tendons, etc. But a stop was put to the progress of this disease
by the advice of Erbenius, the King&rsquo;s physician, with a simple decoction of
fir-tops, by which the most deplorable cases were perfectly recovered, and
the rest of the soldiers prevented from falling into it.</p>

<p>I am inclined to believe by the description given by Cartier of the
ameda tree, with a decoction of the bark and leaves of which his men were
so speedily recovered, that it was the large swampy American spruce tree.</p>

<p>A simple decoction of the tops, cones, leaves or even green bark and
wood of these trees is an excellent antiscorbutic medicine; but it will, I
am apt to think, become much more so when fermented, as in making spruce
beer. By carrying a few bags of spruce or its extract to sea, this wholesome
drink may be prepared at any time. But where it cannot be had the
common fir-tops used for fuel in the ship should be first boiled in water,
and the decoction afterwards fermented with molasses in the common
method of making spruce beer; to which a small quantity of wormwood
and horse-radish root (which it is easy to preserve fresh at sea) may be
added. The juice of the cocoanut tree was experienced to be of very great
benefit to several persons afflicted with the scurvy.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">1</span></a> The best historical review of scurvy is to be found in Hirsch&rsquo;s Handbook
of Geographic and Historical Pathology, from which account we have
drawn many facts.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">2</span></a> The fact that crews of vessels which set sail in winter were more subject
to scurvy than those which set out in the summer must be attributed to
the existence of latent scurvy among the sailors at the time of sailing, rather
than to the season of the year.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">3</span></a> Infantile scurvy is frequently termed &ldquo;Die Moellersche Krankheit.&rdquo;
There seems to be no occasion for giving Moeller credit for discovering this
disease, as he believed that he was dealing with rickets merely in an acute
form. He recognized the clinical similarity to scurvy, but in one of his cases
sharply differentiates it from adult scurvy by the fact that &ldquo;lemon juice
and fresh vegetables&rdquo; were of no avail in the treatment.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">4</span></a> The writer adds that he believes that the health of the natives at
home is protected by Kaffir beer, which they consume even to the amount
of 3 gallons a day, and which is made from germinated Kaffir corn. This
cereal is germinated by steeping it in water for forty-eight hours and is
then dried in the sun. Only enough is prepared for one brew. The French
prepared a similar fermented beverage for these South African laborers;
the sole difference in its mode of preparation was that the corn had not
been germinated.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">5</span></a> The cases on which Wright based his theory were soldiers who developed
scurvy during the siege of Ladysmith. It is probable that the men
were suffering from starvation, purpura and dysentery. That they did not
have scurvy is proved by the fact that they were cured by giving lactate and
bicarbonate of soda.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">6</span></a> In chronic mercurial poisoning the following suggestive symptoms
occur: anemia, bleeding and spongy gums, loosening of the teeth, a quickened
pulse, ulcers of the extremities. At times mercury attacks the nervous
system, producing palsy. The resemblance is heightened by the fact that
calcium metastases have been found in the muscle in experimental scurvy
(Hart and Lessing) comparable to those characteristic of mercurial
poisoning.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">7</span></a> These figures constitute an irrefutable argument against the statement
frequently made that a monotonous diet leads to scurvy. It is only when the
monotonous diet does not contain an adequate quantity of antiscorbutic
vitamine that it is to be feared.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">8</span></a> This is not literally correct, as Doepp described an epidemic of scurvy
in the St. Petersburg Foundling Asylum occurring in 1831.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">9</span></a> During 1919 in Aruba there were 293 births and 30 deaths under one
year, most of these deaths being due to intestinal diseases. The mothers
subsist mainly on maize or guinea small corn, with some goat and sheep
meat, and a little fresh fish, but no vegetables or fruit. The water is brackish.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">10</span></a> Moore raises the interesting question as to whether a diseased condition
of the cow may decrease the vitamines of the milk&mdash;whether a certain
outbreak of scurvy among guinea-pigs might have been due to their having
been fed on the milk of a cow suffering from experimental streptococcus
mastitis. If such proves to be the case, it would have an important bearing
on the question of scurvy and pseudo-scorbutic conditions in nursing infants.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">11</span></a> In the case of the &ldquo;lait maternisé,&rdquo; which is a milk of high fat content,
the dilution of the preparation also must have been a factor. Ounce for
ounce, cream is poorer in antiscorbutic vitamine than an equal quantity of
milk. It is also possible that the mere dilution of milk&mdash;quite apart from
the absolute amount consumed&mdash;is not immaterial in affecting this highly

more antiscorbutic vitamine than does the adult. We know that its
caloric requirement is fully a quarter to a third greater. In regard to vitamine,
judgment cannot be based on experimental evidence, but on comparative
figures. For example, unless we take this viewpoint, we must believe
that, as an infant of six months weighing 15 pounds requires 15 c.c. of
orange juice daily to furnish its antiscorbutic quota, an adult weighing 160
pounds requires 180 c.c. daily&mdash;the juice of three good-sized oranges. On
this basis the adult would require six quarts (6000 c.c.) of fresh milk

subperiosteal hemorrhage in scurvy. In most reports this lesion is
described as if it resulted from a hemorrhage burrowing its way beneath
the periosteum and raising it from the subjacent bone. In point of fact,
such an event is impossible, as will be fully realized when one experiences
the great difficulty in separating periosteum from normal bone. Scurvy involves
a periosteum which is not normal; it is insecurely attached to the
shaft of the bone, so that it is readily stripped off by hemorrhage.</p></div>

protect it from manifest scurvy, if this constitutes its sole antiscorbutic
quota. There is, however, a great difference in the amount of milk which
individual animals consume, so that if we furnish it <i>ad libitum</i> our results
will be irregular, one animal developing scurvy and another remaining well,
according to individual appetite. Frequently guinea-pigs take very little
milk at first, learning gradually to drink more and more, so that it comes
to pass that only after some weeks, if at all, they take sufficient to afford
protection. Under these circumstances, if any addition is made to the
dietary after the experiment has progressed, the lack of development or
cure of the scurvy may mistakenly be attributed to this newly introduced
factor, whereas, in point of fact, it is due to an increased consumption
of milk.</p></div>

this strain results in the escape of blood. In infants the pressure was
usually raised to 90 mm.; in some cases it had to be raised higher in order
to entirely obstruct the return flow of the blood.

protect it against the development of scurvy. We may, however, reach an
approximate estimation of this figure. We know that it takes about 2 c.c.
of orange juice to protect a guinea-pig against manifest scurvy, and about
10 c.c. to protect a baby. The ratio, therefore, between the guinea-pig and
the infant in this regard would seem to be about 5 to 1. We also know that
it takes about 80 to 100 c.c. daily of fresh cow&rsquo;s milk to protect a guinea-pig
for long periods. If we assume the ratio of 5 to 1, it would therefore
seem that it would require about 500 c.c. or a pint, of fresh raw milk
